rar-rsus ‘ro MR. MAcxsnzm, &a ετ

ing learned that he was possessed of some picces of the
oldest Highland poetry in the original, requested of him to

’ show him a translation of one or two of those pieces‚ as a

specimen. Two of these, which were afterwards publish-
ed among the fragments, were accordingly given to Mr
Home, who admired them greatly, and at some distance of
time showed them to me as valuable curiosities.

I being as much struck as Mr Home with the high spirit

part, and representing to him the injustice he would do to
his native country by keeping concealed those hidden trea-

serve to enrich the whole learned world, that I at length
prevailed on him to translate, and bring to me, the several
poetical pieces which he had in his possession. Them I
