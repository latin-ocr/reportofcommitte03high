62 REPORT ou THE

die. His wife Evirchonza, anxious for his fate, em-
barked in a ffiiff, with her infant son Ogall at her
breast, in quest of her lord, whom she found in the
pitiable fituation we have described, and was able to ν
carry to her boat, where they were discovered next

morning by Offian, who had sailed in quest of them,

speechless and dying. He was only able to save the -

child.
The opening of the poem is in that spirit of me-

lancholy which Offian indulges, when he recals the
deeds of the heroes of his race.

⁸ Is not this silence of night mournful,
While (he spreads her dark clouds over the vales ?
Sleep has descended on the youth of the chace
Upon the heath, his dog resting against his knee.
The children of the mountains he pursues
In his dream, while his sseep is forsaking him.—
Sleep‚ ye children of fatigue,
While each star but ascends the height.
Sleep, swift dog of the course,
Offian will not interrupt your ssumbers.
I am watching alone ε
Soothing to me is the gloom of night,
While I travel from dell to dell,
Without hope of morning or dawn.- Α
Spare thy light, O sun !
And do not consume so fast thy torches z
Like the king of the Fingalians‚ genereus is thy foul,
But thy liberality will hereafter fail.
Spare the torches of thousand flames¹
In thy blue hall, when thou goest
Under the dusscy gates to sseep,
Beneath the darken’d lkirt of the western sszy.

’ Spare thern, before they leave thee alone, A
