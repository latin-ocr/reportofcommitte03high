LETTERS To DR. BLAIR· 11

T hat the poems contained in the -manuscripts belonging
to the Macmhurichs‚ were identically the same with those
published by Mr Macpherson, or nearly so, seems to be
abundantly probable. One reason that induces me to enter-
tain this opinion is this ; I have conversed with many diffe-
rent persons who had frequently rehearsed, from memory,
several parts of the poems translated by that gentleman,
long before he was an author ; and Ι can affirm, that these
several parts, together with many more of the same kind,
and in the same manner, were rehearsed by the Macmhu-
rich's times without number. So much in answer to your
first question.

I have, in obedience to your request, made enquiry for
all the persons around me who were able to rehearse from
memory any parts of the poems published by Mr Mac-
pherson‚ and have made them to rehearse, in my hearing,
the several fragments or detached ‘pieces of these poems
which they were able to repeat. This done, I compared
with great care the pieces rehearsed by them with Mr Mac—
pherson's translation. These pieces, or fragments, are as
follows:

The Description of Cuchullin's Chariot ; Fingal, Book
ist, page 11. The rehearsers are, John Macdonald of
Breackish, in Strath‚ Isle of sky, gentleman3 Martia
Macifivray, tenant in Slate 3 and Allan Macaskle, farmer,

The Episode relating to Faineasolis; Fingal, Book 3d,
page 45. The rehearsers are, among many more, John
