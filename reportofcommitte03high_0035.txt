coPY oF ANOTHER LETTER FROM THE SAME To
THE SAME.

MY DEAR sm,

I am very glad you have undertak-

‘to you, Nothing less than what you propose will
serve the purpose. You need expect no assistance
from Macpherson, who flew into a paffion when I
told him of the letter I had wrote to you ε But you
must not mind so strange and heteroclite a mortal‚
than whom I have scarce ever known a man more
perverse and unamiable. He will probably depart
for Florida with Governor, Johnstone, and Ι would
advise him to travel among the Chickisaws or Che-
rokees‚ in order to tame him and civilize him.

Ι should be much pleased to‘hear of the success of
your labours. Your method of direffing to me is,
under cover to the Earl of Hertford‚ Northumber-

, that direffion, will be sent over to me at Paris.

I have no present thoughts of publishing the work
you mention 3 but when I do, I hope you have no
objection of my dedicating it to you.

I beg my compliments to Robertson and Jardine.
I am very sorry to hear of the state of Ferguffon's
health. John Home went to the country yesterday
with Lord Bute.' I was introduced the other day to
