·ly introduced into some poems and tales, in which it ought
to have no place. I remember, for instance, to have
heard 30 years ago, a long tale (recited by one M‘Phail,
a taylor in Lorn), of which the hero was Conal Gulbann
mac righ Lochlann‚ and if I had then translated it, Ι would
have called him, as Ι heard him called, son of the ‘king of
Lochlin. But this Conal Gulbann appears from Irish his-

, tory to have belonged not to Scandinwia, but to Loigh-

eann (Lagenia) in Ireland. Thus, some of Mt M.’s in·—

advertencies‚ in which he plainly appears to have followed
the oral recitation, without a due investigation into history,
may tend to illustrate the authencity of his poems. So
may also the description of some soenes, and names of
places, of the existence of which he had no opportunity

' of having any knowledge3 as Ι had formerly occasion to
show in one or two instances. Proverbial expressions,

names of places, called time out of mind after some of Os-

sian's heroes, allusions to their customs and manners, with
the remains of these poems being still found in Irelancl (as
well as in the Highlands of Scodand, as testified by Μι-

Walker in his History of the Irish bards), and the notices
occasionally to be met with in old Scottish and Irish wri-
ters on this subject, would also tend to throw much light

¹ upon your enquiry. The institution of bards, retained in
the families of several chieftains till the present century,
will account for the preservation of these poems by oral
tradition3 as will also the manners of the people, whose
winter-evening entertainment was, νῒίΠ very lately, the re-
petition of poems, tales, and songs. The language of
these poems being still intelligible, excepting some words,

'ffiay be accounted for, from having been constantly'repeat-
ed and made familiar! and from the Highlanders having
'always remainecl a separate people, secluded from the rest
of the world by their peculiar Ianguage, customs, and
manners. So the wild Arabs retain, I believe, to this day,
