66 LETTERS 'ro MR,¹ ΜΑοιζΕΝΖῐΕ, &a

3. From the Rev. Dr. CARLYLE, to WM M’DonAm,
ESQ Secretary to the Highland Society‚ dated Mussel«
burgh, 9th january 1802.

DEAR Sm,

An accident has brought to my remem-
brance an engagement I made to you many months ago,
which I now shall endeavour to fulfil. The subject may
not be important, but the age of the witness admonishes
him to give his evidence without loss of time.

On the 2d day of October 1759,· (I happen to know the
date exactly), I came from the neighbourhood of Dumfries
to Moffnt in the morning, and finding J0hn Home, the
author of Douglas, there, I resolved tobstay all day with
him. In the course of our conversation, he to-Id me tha-t
he had at last found what he had been long wishing for,
a person who could make him acquainted with ancient ¹
Highland poessry, of which he had heard so much. This·
'was James Maepherson‚ who was then tutor to Mr Gra-2
ham of Baigowan, whom he had, with much solicitation
and difficulty, prevailed with to‘translate some specimens·
οἱ that poetry which he had by heart, hut which, he said,
he con-ld not do justice to in an English translation. Μι-
Home had been highly delighted with thern ; and when he
shewed them to me, I was perfectly astonished at the poe·-v
tica} genius displayed in them. We agreed that it was a
precious discovery, and that as soon as possible it should
be published to the world. Μι- Home carried the manu-
script with him soon after t'o Edi'nburgh3‘ and having

· shown icto Dr Blair, and other good judges, they werex

so much pleased that they encouraged ΜΓ Macpherson to

publish them without delay, which he did early in the*
year 1760, with the title* of Fragments <ff Ancient Poetr5

collected in the Hzghlanda
