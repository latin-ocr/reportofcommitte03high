sponds a1most exactly with Sliabh nam beannfionn in Kene
nedy's Collection‚ p. 29. The number of verses is the
same in both, and even the order of them, with two excep-
tions which do not alter the sense. Some variation occurs
in the reading at the 20th‚ 36th‚ 44th, and 48th ve'rseS. It
is observabk, that the argument or preface of this piece, as
given by Mt. Kennedy‚ makes the number of hunters 3000,
whereas t-he poem, written -in his own hand, has only 1000,
which corresponds with ‘the MS. of the Dean. Mr. Ken-
nedy's arguments, indeed, are frequently at variance with
the poems to which they are prefixed; a mistake that may
'have probably resulted from a disposition in the recitet
to exaggerate the subject of the poem in his preliminary
account of it.

A less perfect edition of this beautiful poem is also
found under the title of La mor Seilg na hinne, in the oral
recitations mmmunicated by the Rev. Francis Stewart‚ mi-
nister of Craignish; and another still more corrupted, was
written from mernory by Archibald M‘Callurr1, and com,-
muizi'cated'through Mr. Malcolm M‘Donald.

4. A poem by Fearghas Fili (p. 5230) being the report
which that bard made to Fingal of Oscar's having fallen on
the field of Gavra, corresponds very much with anedition
of Kennedy's (p. 148), and another of Mr. Malcolm Mae
Donald’ ,ες neither of which is inferior to the Dean' s. The
two last lines of the following stanza are even more happi
ly expressed' ln Kennedy’ s edition than in his.

Chunnaic e righ Eirean
Shios ar lar a chatha ζ
Is thug ruathar chuige

Mar bhuinne re caraig.

It is to be observed, that this report of Fergus the bard
appears in the editions of Mr. M‘Donald and Kennedy‚ as
