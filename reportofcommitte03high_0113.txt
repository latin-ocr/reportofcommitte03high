produce the book which Mr Maepherson secmed dc-
firous to confign to oblivion. Having arraigncd
Macpherson at the ‘bar of the public, as one of the
first literary impostore in modern times, Ι have im-
posed an opposste obligation on his friends to vindi-
cate and rescue his memory, if they czm, from the
imputation of forgery ; after which no reason can
be affigned for withholding the book, but that it:
‘would serve for his conviffion. Such is the plain
state of the fac] ; and if his friends are not at liberty
to produce the book, the only circumstance that
could suppose an obligation to suppress it, is, that it
would serve for his detefflon. Very posstbly it con-
taius nothing to the purpose3 but vhe ’book would
have been produced long ago, *had‘it afforded a sm-
gle proof of the authenticity of Offian 3 and, in the
impartial publications of the Highland Society‚ no
part of the evidence should appear to be suppreffed.

1 do not mean by this, that the bos)k;²itself should
be publiffied‚ but that it should be transmitted to the
Highland Society for public inspeftion3 otherwise
I must conclude that a part of the evidence, the most
injurious to Macpherson, has ‘been withheld by his.
friends. I am, my Lord, ‘with respect and esteem>
your Lordstxsp's most obedient -humble servant,
