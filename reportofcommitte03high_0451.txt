Ι But the most numerous class are such as are proved to
be of Celtic origin by their roots or derivatives being conf
,fined to that language, or their kindred and dependents be-
ing widely diffused in it. Such are the Teutonic riech and
riki a kingdom, and muer a sorry horse or jade. The for-
mer, which is ,synonimqus with the Scots or Irish rzghe and
rioghachd‚ has its ,origin in the Celtic mgb, which is the Scots
,or Irish for king, as rbi and ,rhujy are the Welch‚ ruy the
cornish, and *rue the armoric ᾧ. The latter is allied to the
Cornish marh‚the Welch and Armoric march, and the Scots
and Irish marc, a horse : from which a large family of
words has sprung, as for instance, Scots and Irish marcach
a rider, marcachd riding, maa-mich (imperative mood or
¹root) to ride, marc-asach abounding in homes, marchoiling a
horse-fface, marcl‘ann a stable‚ marcshluagh cavalry, marc·-

marekaom, a horsernan or rider 3 Welch marchogaeth, arme-

† The learned Ihre derives the Swedish and Icelundic Riki from Rik, which
is spotcns in Latin, and is in faci the 'same with the English rich, and the Ger·
man, Flemish, French, Italian,¹ and Spanish reich, riic, riche, ricco, rien, whence
riches, reichthumb‚ riiedom, &e. ‘are naturally derived. But as Βασιλεια comes of
Βασιλεγς, regnum of rex, kingdom ot¹ king, and ‘royaume of roy, so riki and
S‘iech are derived 'in the usual course *from τὶ ox· righ borrowed from the Celtic
by the Teutonic‚ in which it is the less to be wondered that it has been long·
since lost, that it has been for ages obsolete even in the Welsh.
