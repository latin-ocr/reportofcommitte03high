‘44- REPORT oN ‘rim

DEAR 511³, Kincardine, 4th March 1801.

Ihave, as far as my judgment and
ν recolleffion served me, made a communication to
the Highland Society concerning Ossian's poems. A

certain conjeElure of mine Ι venture to bring under ’
your view and Mr Charlee M‘Intolh's, to be dispos-
ed of as your judgment will dire& I remember
Mr Maepherson reading the MSS. found in Clan-
ronald's‚ execrating the bard who dietated to the
amanuensis, saying, ‘ D n the scoundrel, it is
he himself that now speaks, and not Offian.’ This
took place in my house, in two or three instances :
1 thence conje&ure that the MSS. were kept up, lest
they should fall under the view of such as would be
more ready to publish their deformities than to point

out their beauties.
It was, and I believe still is well known, that the

broken poems of Offian, handed down from one
generation to another, got corrupted. In the state
of the Highlands, and its language, this evil, Ι ap-
prehend, could not be avoided3 and I think great
credit is due, in such a case, to him who restores a

l work of merit to its original purity.

 

' Befides the persons already mentioned, the only
other gentleman particularly acquainted with Mr Ι

Maepherson's proceedings, in the course of his col-
