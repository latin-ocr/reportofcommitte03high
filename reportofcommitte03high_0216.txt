ments to Principal Robertson. Ι am,

⁷ in the Isle of Sky, dated Kz'lmuir, *ath April 1764.

γ anmmn ΑΜ) DEAR Sm,
Ι, wrote you some months

ago an answer to a letter I had from you about the authen-
ticity and antiquityhf Ossian’s poems, and though Ι am
not sure whether you received it or not, Ι cannot help pre-
vailing with myself to acquaint you further, by a person
who goes from here to Edinburgh‚ that I had for these
twenty days with me a rehearser of ancient songs‚ whom
Sir James Macdonald ordered to see me from Long-island.
He had little more to say for your purpose, than what I
acquainted you of already, and, Ι believe, farther disco-
veries would be too late for the present edition. I have
heard the description of Cuchullin's car repeated by seve-
rals, with some variations τ it is very grand in the original 3·
there are four horses described in it, with a long string of
epithets applied to each, of which the translator dropped
a few through his fingers. It is surprising to find some
learned critics doubt that Cuchullin was master of such a
, car, who cannot be ignorant that Cassivelaunus made use
of them against Caesar, that Galgacus had them at' the
Grampian hills, Etdocilis rector rostrati Belga Covim‘,
