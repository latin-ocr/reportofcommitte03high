his possession, containing Mr Maepherson' s first es-
says 111 English poetry, which he did not choose, or
conceive himself at liberty to rescue from that obli—
vion to which the author seemed to have configned

Maepherson's poetical common-place book, con·

Highlands, than the discovery of a prior epic poem
by Macpherson, containing the same sentiments, ima-
gery, and expreffions with his Offian3 and as the
same resemblance may be traced in his leffer poems,
lately published from 'the Scots Magazine, I am
entitled ²to conclude, that those first effays of his
muse in English, if fairly produced, would afford
the same convincing (101οἃ10118 of Offian. It is in
{zain to say that Mr Anderson is not at liberty to
