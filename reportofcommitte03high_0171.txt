‘ A mhacain cheann
Nan cursan strann
Ard leumnach righ na’n sseagh
Lamh threin 'sguch eds
Croidhe ard gun sexi
Ceann airm nan riun gear goirt
Gearr fios gu bas
Gun bharc she61 δέη
Bhi snamh ma dhubh Innishtore
Mar tharnanech bhaoil
Do bhuill a laoieh
Do {huil mar chaoir ad cheam
Mar charaic chruin
Do chroidhe gun roinn
Mar laffan oidheh do lana
»Cum suar do scia
Is crobbhui nial
Mar chih bho reul a bhaish
A mhacain cheann
Nan cursan strann

Sgrios naimhde fios gu lar.³

ί Offspring of the chiefs
Of suerting, high-bounding {stede}
King of spears !
Strong arm in every trial ;
‘Ambitious heart without difinay3
