that for some months he left all the originals of his trans* J²
latiori open to inspection 'and examination‚ in Becket the ³

bookseller's shop, and intimated, by advertisement in ther

Nevsspapers, that he had done so. But when, after their
being left there for a considerable time, he found that no
one person had ever called to look at them, his disdain of

and dissimulation‚ which such a character and such an un-
dertaking would have required. He was proud, high-spi-
rited, and disdainfu13 irritable to a degree, when his honour
andveracity were impeached3 not very apt, on any occa-
