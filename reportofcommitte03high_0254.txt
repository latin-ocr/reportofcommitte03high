LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE,

 

1. From Ductor JoHN ΞΜΙΤΗ, dated Campbeltom· leth
Septernber 17972

Sm,
I ΗΑΒ the honour of your letter of· the alst ·
ult. with the printed queries circulated by the Highland
Society of Scotland relative to Ossian's poema-L. On the
subjectos these queries, I advanced all I had to say long
ago ; and if any thing fell in my way since, pro or con, it ,
was allowed to pass unnoficed, as I never intended to be- ¹
stow any further thoughts upon the matter, If, however,
upon recollection, any thing new, or more explicit, shall
occur to my memory, I shall state it; but cannot help
thinking, with all due deference to better judges, that the
1nvestigation set on foot by the Society‚ would do better
after the poems should have been first published, and ale,-
‘lowed to speak, at least m part, for themselves.
