Rev. DEAR Bnormzn,
’ ’ Ι received your favour of
the 5th of October some time in November last, and J
would have acknowledged it long ago if I did not expect

’ to find more satisfactory answers to your enquiries than ἶ

could give of myself. My copy of Fing‘al happened to be
borrowed by an acquaintance at a distance; there wax
some time lost before Ι could procure another, in a placo
where there are but very few of them, and where the comss
munication, especially in the winter season, is not easy m·
frequent. In the mean time, I employed Mr M’Tavis]1‚
minister of Morven, to whom you wrote, and who is
zealous to give you all the satisfaction in his power,
to transmit to you all that Mr Campbell of Octomore‚ an
aged gentleman in his neighbourhood, knows of these
poems of Ossian. This man assured me, that, in his
younger days, he heard F ingal repeated very frequently i n
the original, just as Mr Maepherson has translated it. He
lived then in the island of Ila: I employed some of my
friends there to enquire whether this poem is still exant
there, but without success. Ι was informed also, that a
man who died in this island about fifteen years ago, had. a,
’manuscript of the poems of Ossian. Ι wrote· to a nephew
‘of his, into whose hands that man’s books and papers have
fallen, but have had no answer hitherto. I soon will3 and
if this manuscrIPt can be got, you shall have as particu-
lar an account of it as I can give you. I examined all the
persons in this or the other parishes in Mull, who have
any poems in Gaelic of FingaL or his heroes. There are

still a great many of them handed down by tradition3 buz>
