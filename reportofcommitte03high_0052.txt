poeti-y· of the Highlands, in concert with another
gentleman of equal knowledge in their language‚
and with still better opportunities‚ from his fitua-
³ tion, of collecting the best that remained. MrPope’s
own account of this proposed undertaking will be
found in a letter to Dr mair, contained in the Ap-
‘pendix‚ ΝΟ. 3.

The neXt collector of Gaelic poetry, in order of
time, was the celebrated James Maepherfon, whose
transsations first attracted, in any eminent degree,
the notice of the literary world to that species of
compofition.

Of the manner in which Mr Macpherson was*
first induced to transsate fragments of ancient Gaelic
poetry‚ and then to colle& and publish the greater
poems, of which so many editions have been since
given to the world, the Committee has obtained an
account ³* from the following gentlemen, well ac-
quainted with the circumstances, the authority of
whose relation will readily be acknowledged by the
public.

The Reverend Dr Blair,

† Dr Adam Ferguson,

The Reverend Dr Carlisse‚ and
Mr Home, author of Douglas.

to form on the business of the Committee.
