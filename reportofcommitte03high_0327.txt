’ ‘⁸ the first book of Maepherson's Temora. It opens
⁶⁶ with a lamentation for the death of Chaoilte‚ which is
” ‘⁶ foreign to the rest of the song3 a practice not uncommon
ζ “ among the poerns attributed to Ossian, and similar to
‘⁶ that of Pindar‡.” ἡ

y Now, in this poem we observe the following passages—-
ζ -V- 3. ⁶⁶ Did you hear of Fingal’s journeys on every forest

.ss ⁴¹⁶ in Erine Great Cairbar with his armour sent for usto

‘⁶ destroy us.'’ Be it remarked that forest, in the English
' of scotland, does not mean an extensi-ve wood, but a moun-
ἴ tainous tract which is stocked., or abounds, with deer and
¹· other game.
Ἰ V. 6‚-—12. ‘⁶ The last day of our drinking match,
ζ· ⁶⁶ Cairbar spoke with his tremendous voice. ⁶ Ι want we
Ε ⁶⁶ should exchange arms, brown Oscar, that comest from
,χ π Albion.⁷ oscar. ⁶ What exchange do you want to
ξ ⁶⁶ make, great Cairbar‚ who even press the ships into your
‘⁶ service3 and to whom I and all my host belong, in time
'⁶‘ of war and battle. Surely it isv oppression to demand
J ‘⁶ our heads when we have not arms to defend ourselves.
f ‘⁶ The reason of your doing so is our being deprived of
¹⁶ 'Fingal and his son. Were Fingal and my father with
‘⁶ us as they used to be, you would not during your whole
. ⁶‘ life obtain the breadth of your feet in Erin.
‘⁶ The great hero (Cairbar) was filled with rage at the
'j'f‘ dispute which arose between them. There were ex-
,⁶⁶ ceeding horrible words between Cairbar and Oscar.
f ⁶⁶ That night the women had a warm dispute about the
s ‘³ heroes, and even C‘airbar and Oscar themselves were
‘⁶ half and half angry.

⁶⁶ Nine scote men armed with bows‘ and arrows, that
‘¹‘ came ·to destroy v1133 a-ll these fell by the hand of Oseaf
ῃ “enraged at the sons of Ireland †.'’
