hind us? The rock of Anteus ,they call tha't rock, said
the young man3 and the hill of Wrestli-ng is the name of

named? said Curio. If it be not tedious to you, I shall
tell it at full length, replied the African lad. Tell it mi·-

Indeed was the strength of that person3 for neither one man
nor many could contend with him, because when his
strength failed, he would let himself down to the ground,
and as soon as his side touched the earth, he was filled with
wondrous vigour from his proper mother the earth. Yet
he rarely needed this resource. For none was found who
could resist his strength. The inhabitants of the land fell
by him, and no ship that entered the port below could r‘e.
tire in safety from him: so that he wasted the whole of
this country, and none dated to approach it either by sea or

land.

After the country around him became a wilderness, his ⁴

subsistence was the flesh of moose, and dcer, beasts ofprey,

bears, and lions, which he daily killed in the wilderness.
He had neither rushes, nor branches, nor skin, nor rug,

nor tartan plaid, * for his bed—but his side to the ground.

 

This ancient author ⁴appears to have had the following V
passage of Lucan in his eye:

[Curio]-—Gastra locat cano procul aequore, qua se
Bagrada lentus agit siccae sulcator arenae.

³' The original word, breacan is the well known plaid of the Caledoniam,
which supplied them with a dress by day, and a covering at night·
