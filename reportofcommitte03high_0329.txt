V. s‚—5.- “ Ossian. It is a pitiful tale, O Patrick!
.“ that thou tellest me the Clerk qf:’' [a mistake of the
g }“ translator for me ‘ff' O Clerkl] ⁶⁴ Why should I be reli-
· “gious, if heaven be not in the possession of the heroes οἱ
“Fingal. '”
‘St. Patrzck. How wicked is that, O Ossian. ' thou
⁴ : ‘⁶ who usest blasphemous expressions z God is much
ν “ more mighty than all the heroes of Albion.”
“ Ossian. I would prefer one mighty battle, fought by
ξ “ the heroes of Fingal‚ to the God of thy worship, and
“ thee, O Clerk i”
V. 19,-21. “ St. Patrick. He is now bound in hell,
· *ὅ who used to distribute gold. Because he was a despiset
. ‘of God, he has hell for his portion.”
‘ossium If the children of Morni, and the many tribes
ξ ‘⁴ of the children of Ovi‚; were yet alive3 we would force
‘⁶ the brave Fingal out of hell, or the habitation should be
ἐμ our own.’'
‘⁶ St. Patrick. Valiant as you imagine the brave Scots
ἶ· ’“ were3 yet Fingal they would not release, though they
,1. “ should be there themselves.''
Ξ - It must be remarked, that an ambiguity which might be
Ψ . alleged to result in the last of these verses, from the name
„fzof Scots‚ which extended to natives of Ireland soon after
’ἑκτὴε age of St. Patrick, is occasioned by a perversion of the
ἐμ original ;
’ξ “ V. 21. Cion fheodhna na Halabinn maseach
⁸⁹} ⁴ ‘⁶ Air leatsa gum ba mhor am feutn
‘⁶ Cho dtuga sin F iunn arnach
‘⁶ Ged bhiodh an teach aguibh fein.''
The literal meaning of which is this :
The leaders of the host of Albion, in s‘uccession,
Great as you deem their prowess‚
Could not effect the release of Fingal,

Though the habitation were your own.
