All the Gaelic MSS. in the possession of the Society
written from the earliest period till after the isth century
(with the single exception of the Dean of Lisrnore’s vo-
lume) are written in the very ancient form of character
which was common of old to Britain and Imland, and
which was adopted by the Saxons at the time of their con-
version. For the last forty years it seems to have been dis-
continued in Scotland3 the last specimen which the Society
have received of it, being a volume of Songs, in which is
included one of Duncan Macintyre'87—-entitled‚ An Taileir
Mac Neachdain, which he composed in 1752„ between
which and the year 1768, it is probable that the volumein
question was written, because the first edition of Macin-
tyre’s Songs was published in that year.

A Deed of Foster-age in this collection between Sir Nor-
man Macleod and John Mackenzie executed in the year
1645 shows that the Gaelic language was not disused in
legal obligations at that period·
