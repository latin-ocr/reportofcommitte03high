There are a hundred pisces in the ffighiands 'and Isles,
which derive their names from the Fe'innffi and from cir-
cumstances connected with their history. The properties
of t'ne grounds, and the traditions universany attached to
them,- correspond with the strain of Ossian’s poetry. These
traditions have been handed down from generation to gene-
ration, and still exist. The names of men, and of clans
or tribes, either prior to Ossian, or coeval with him, w'hich
we can all mention, prove that the Fe'z'mze inhabited our
Highlands and Isles ; and we have genealogies of some
families which reach back to these early times, and to some
of the heroes whom he celebrated.

The names of men, and of place5‚ are significant to a
degree, found only in an original language: and Ossian’s
expressions are so peculiarly and wonderfully happy, that
no man can translate or change them, without losing the
aptness‚ substance, melody, and perfect beauty‚ which
distinguish the pure Gaelic of Ossian alone, through all his
works.

Resides„ we find over the Highlands and Isles many mo-
numents of the good sense andingenuity of Ossian’s heroes.
These evince that they possessed arts that enabled them to
perform works, of which their degenerate descendants
cannot comprehend the method, nor even conceive the pos-
sibility, -of execution.

Among the powers with which the F e'z‘nne had to contend,
in defence of their lands and liber-ties, or in support of their
allies, we have mention made of ‘⁴ The king of the
world. ’' There is no character to which we can suppose
this epithet applicabk, excepting the Sovereign of Rome,
whose controul extended over more of our Globe, than
that of any othe'r recorded in history.

The Scandiliavians (Loch‘iinnich) who invaded the Isles
and Highlands‚ long after the times of the Fesinne, were not
able to change the language, or to destroy the monuments
