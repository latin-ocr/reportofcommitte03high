‘78 LETTERS To Mn. mmmmm-:⁶

author who wrote near the beginning of last century, that.
St Patrick had actually a convert, a disciple of this name,
*who was afterwards dignified with the title of St Ossin‚ or
Ossian, who is no doubt the speaker in this poem ;⁴ which
Colgan, who mentions it, observes, could not be ascribed
to the son of FiugaL who lived long before the time of St.
Patrick, or, as he says, in the reign of king Cormac.
Τ116 same author, in a note to a passage in which mention
⁷ is made of Fingal (or Finnius filius Cubhaui), in one of
the lives of St Columba, says he was much celebrated in
poems and tales inter suos ,· by which, Ι suppose he means
that he belonged to this country, and not to Ireland‚ as in
that case he would have said inter nos trates. But as it is not
your objeot at present to ascertain the time and place, but
only the poetry of Ossian, I will not enter into any histo«
rical, chronological, or topographical disquisition, which
would exceed the ordinary bounds of a letter, already suf-
ficiently long. Such a disquisition, however, would be
very satisfying, and should make a part of your plan, as ’
it would not only add to the weight of other evidence, but>
go a great length to account for the peculiar manners of
the poetry‚ and go far to remove some of the strongest
objections that have been made to the authenticity of Os-
sian. Some· of these objections have been occasioned by
Mt M.'s notes, and are not chargeable on the poet3 such
as that in which he supposes Ossian⁷s epithet of Caracm'l
or Garghuil, (fierce-‹eyed) to be a proper name, and to·
mean Caracalla. I suspect also, that although Lochlan
(as appears from several passages of a very ancient Irish
or Gaclic author now before me) was of old a general
name with us for all Germany as well as Scandinavia, ΜΓ
M. may have sometimes implicitly used it (as I did myae
sslf,) in conformity to oral recitation, without attending·
always to- the circumstances of the case. Our later intera
course with the Danes. occasioned Lochlan to be frequente ,
