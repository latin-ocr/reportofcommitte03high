cLETTERs TO DR. BLAIR· 27

‘afflue was unequal to the task of composing the original
poems, ascribed to that ancient hero. a

’ Upon the whole, I think it is evident that even a man,
who has no access to know the sentiments of Highlanders
on this subject, and their unanimous testimony in favour
of Mr Maepherson, can very easily satisfy himself that
that gentleman could have no rational inducement to im-
pose upon the public 3 and, at any rate, could not possibly
succeed in doing it, in the manner of which some are
pleased to suspect him3 and it proceeds entirely from your
good natured indulgence to their unreasonable prejudices,
*that you are at so much pains to satisfy them in idle
doubts, which you never entertained yourself, and for
which one would be certainly laughed at in the Highlands, ν
where, if they complain at all of Mr Maepherson, it is
because he has omitted many beautiful pieces of Ossian’s
works, and not that he has corrupted them by any addi-
¹tions of his own.

The public do not know how much they are indebted to
you in this affair. If they have received any pleasure
'from their acquaintance with the works of Ossian, they
‚owe it all to yon. The remains of the Celtic bard would
haxe been irretrievably lost, if you had not interposed to
rescue them from the total obliviou to which they would
very soon have been consigned. The Highlanders‚ at least,
¹ are very sensible of this ; and they acknowledge also, that
„you have enabled them to comprehend more perfectly the
fflsssit and beauties of their favourite bard. Ι am,

Reverend Sir,
Your most obedient
humble servant,
ALEXR. MAc Apim.
