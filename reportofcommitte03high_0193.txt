⁸ publication, I have carefully compared the translation'with
ι the copies of the originals in my hands, and find it amaz-
. ingly literal, even in such a degree, as to preserve, in some
measure, the cadence of the Gaelic versification. I need
i not aver, Sir, that these poems are taken in this country to
be of the utmost antiquity. This is notorious to almost an
those who speak the Gaelic language in Scotland. In the
Highlands, the scene of every action is pointed out to this
day3 and the Historical Poems of Ossian have been, for
ages, the winter evening amusement of the clans. Some

’ of the hereditary bards retained by the chiefs, commit-

ted very early to writing some of the works of Ossian.
One manuscript in particular was written as far back as
the year 1410, which I saw in ΜΓ Macpherson's posses-
sion. Permit me, Sir, as a Higfflander, to make use of

·. this opportunity to thank you, for the pains you have

taken to illustrate the beauties, and establish the reputatiom
⁶ ,of the poems of Ossian, which do so much honour to the
ancient genius of our country. I am, with great esteem,
Sir,
' Your most obedient servant,
LACHLAN M'PHERSON.

DEAR Sm,

Soon after your letter carne to hand, I
wrote upon the subject of it to several gentlemen who live ’
at a considerable distance from the place of my residence,
and did myself the pleasure at the same time to examine,
jn compliance with your request, 311 the persons in my
-. neighbourhood that could be of any service.
