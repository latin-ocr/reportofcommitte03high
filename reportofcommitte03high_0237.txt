· , much charmed with the descriptions contained in them; and

some of the sentiments were noble and sublime: to this
end, we insormed ourselves as to those old people that
could repeat parts of them, and got their name, but we
could not, from the best information, learn that there was
any manuscript of them in this part of the kingdom. We
