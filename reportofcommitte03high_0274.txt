9ss LETTERS To MR. MAGKENZIE.

nor the desire to enquire into the matter. But I consider
the combatants in the dispute in the same light with the
two knights who fought about the shield hung between ·
them3 the one maintaining it was white, the other it was
black, while each looked only on the side that was next
him; so that both were partly in the right, and partly

other, is more than the translator himself, were he alive, A
could now do, if he had not begun to do so from the ⁴
beginning. Even then he might not be sure of the ge.-

or suspicions.

Iam sorry I have not beside me a copy of my trans-
