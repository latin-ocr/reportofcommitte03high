ssowly around, to view the one of the brightest face,
lifting with fear their head& 3 when they behold thy
beauty while asseep, they fiy without strength from
thy fide. Take thou thy rest, O sun! and return

again with joy.' ²*

they shrink away with sear. Rest in thy shadowy cave, O sun !

Let thy return be in joy. Macpherfi Tratffi
