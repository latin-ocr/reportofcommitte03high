64 ατὰ-ΕΗΒ ro MR. MACKEnzrz', &a

To the third and fourth queries, I can say nothing, as 1
am not now in the neighbourhood to which they refer.
’ To the fifth, please to know that I have, very early in
my life, and of course very long, heard of Fingal and his
race of heroes, and of poetry on their subject, to be found
some where in the Highlands. But as to my qualification
