And in the. ancient MS, which formerly was the
dean of Lismore's, now in the poffeffion of the So-
cletyx

‘ Di wamyn beggane ssoyeg·
Ag ess royg· ny negg·in mawle'
Di chemyn fa holt yr lerr
Currych mor agus ben ann.

Keigyt leich yownych mane reie-
Fa mat· er gneeit⁰ er gy· gart

There was a {horter and mo‘re rapid measure for
the lyrical parts of the composition3 such was gea
nerally used for the Prosnacha Catha‚ the song of
incitement to battle, which it was the office of the
bards to fing, to animate the heroes when about to
engage the enemy. Such is the measure of some of
the odes given by miss Bmoke, and of the war-
song to Gaul, which is in the poffeflion of the So-
ciety. The opening of this war-song, as in one of
the Kilbride MSS. is as follows z its measure is quick,
rnpid, and spirit-stirring‚ each line generally con-
taining one or two daelyls.

‘ Goll mear mileanta,
Ceap na crbdhachta,
Lixr'nh fhial arrachd'‚
Mian na mordhachta.
Leoghar luath adhbhal,
Leonadh lan biodhbffldh,
Tonn go treun thoirneadh‚

Goll
