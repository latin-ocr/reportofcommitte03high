The queries sent me may be elucidated in Bade-
noch and Lochaber. You may gather from what
is above, that this corner can do little in that line.

When summer comes, if my health serves me, 1
shall make it my busmess to see· certain old men,
though ata confiderable distance from here, who,
Ι am told, do still retain some· of Offian's poemS.

The gentleman to whom I referred in my former
correspondence, as a familiar acquaintance of ΜΡ
Maepherson’s and mine, and distinguished for' his
acquaintance with the Gaelic language, is, alas! no
more. His name was Lachlane Maepherson of
Strathmashy. He died in the 1767. Ι have the
honour to be, with great respest, Sir, the Highland
Society’s, and your, most obedient humble servant,

ANDREW GALmE.

In his private correspondence with his friend the
Reverend Dr Kemp, Mr Gallie ventured a conjec-
¹ture with regard to the MSS. procured by Mr Mac-
pherson‚ which he had scen in that gentleman’s pos-
session, though his modesty had not allowed him to
mention it in a corre”p011dence of so public a nature
as that with the Committee. This conjeClure is ⁸
expreffed in the following extra& of a letter (the
greatest part of which is on prfx'ute bufiness> to Dr
Kemp.
