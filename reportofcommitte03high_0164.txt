136 REPORT ON THE

‘ Dh’ eirich gath o dharaig liath 3
Bha fleagh nan triath air an fhraoch.’ ,

‘ The flame rose from the grey νοῑιιῙς,
The feast of heroes was on the heath.'

⁶ The flame of three oaks arose ; the feast is spread aroumdss

The epithet of grey, applied to the oak, is much
more natural and pieturesque than the number three
adopted by Macpherson, without any authority from
the original 3 and the eireumstance of the feast being
spread on the heath denotes the fimplicity of the meal‚
which Maepherson, thinking it probably too mean
to have only the ground for a table, has changed
into ¹the general term around. ‘ The feast is spread
around.’ , ’

In the same manner may be traced through the
whole poem the simple >description of the original,
the figurative and ornamented expreffion of the trans-
lation. The conclusion which an irnpartial reader
will draw from the comparison, the Committee
thinks must be favourable to the authenticity of the
origina13 01· at least that he will form a decid d opi-
nion, that, on the su-xpofition of both being fabri-
·cate .,d the Englilh must have been fabricated the last,
which is a circumstance of xfery confiderable weight
in the present inquiry.

Were the Committee inclined to indulge them-
selvelQ in tracing fimilitudes‚ (an exercise of the ima-
gination, which, from the time of Flzcellen down-
‘wards³ generally affords conviffion only to the dis-
