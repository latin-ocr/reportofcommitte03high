The design of the Farmers Magazine is to collect and
disseminate ingenious Theories, important and well au-
thenticated Facts, and accurate Experiments, which relate
to the different branches df Rural Econorny. It must be
well known to every person in the least acquainted with
the different parts of the United Kingdom, that discoveries
and improvements, particularly in Agriculture‚ travel very
slowly. To remedy this, the Farmers Magazine was first
projected3 and the Proprietors are happy to say, that, if
they may judge from the almost? *mprecedented sale of
more than 4000 copies of each Nmnber, the object of this
publication is in a great degree answered. The work, in
its plan and arrangement, is well calculated for the end
the Proprietors had in view3 it consists of—l. Miscella-
neous Communications‚ chiefly of the most important prac-
tical nature-42. The Review of 'Agricultural Publications.
-3‚ Agricultural Intelligence from almost every district
in Scotland, and from several in England. The utility
and importance of this braneh must be evident to every
practica] Fames, who, at the moderate price of Two Shil-
lings a quarter, may learn the state of the crops, and the
price of grain, cattle, &a in the different parts of the
kingdom, besides being enabled to compare his· own prae-,i
tice with that in other districts, and thus to correct what ἐς,

improper or deficient.-
