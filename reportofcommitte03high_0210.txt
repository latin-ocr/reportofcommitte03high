26 LETTERS To DR. BLA'IR.

sired, by m'en upon whose judgment he could, with the
most perfect security, rely. Now, if we pay Mr Mac-
pherson the extravagant compliment of supposing him the
real author of the several poems in his collection, why
should he chuse‚ without temptation or necessity, to expose
himself to the hazard of being detected of an imposture, a.
