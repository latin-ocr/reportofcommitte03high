OF Pomm.

ξ* Since then to me the glory fell
Thy valour to subdue,
My arm shall now thy foes repel,
Nor injure those who spe. ’

{For thou thyself an hero art,
Though fortune on thee frown3
Rise therefore free, and free depart‚

With unimfiair’d ienown.

Or chuse, strong aim of powerful might!
Chuse, Magnus, now thy course: -
With generous foes in peace unite,
Or dare again their force.

Better our friends-bip to engngc,
And be in peace ally’d‚

Than thus eterna] warfare wago, .
Defying and defy’d.'’

f? O never more my arm, through life‚
Against thee, Finn, shall rise 3
O never such ungrateful strife
Shall Mehee’s son devise Ε

And Ο ! that on their hills of snow
’ My youths had stin remain’d‚
Nor thus against a genereus foe

³ Unprosperous war maintain’d ἔ

Exulting in their conscious might,

Ι And glorying in their fame,

And gay with spoils of many a fight,
⁵ ’ And flush’d with hope they came Β
