As their ‘swords were subduing the mighty1
My father was driving the battle
Where it pressed the most;
Nor from him did bodily form retire unmaimed.
In the light of his steps Ι strove to follow.
But frail is my strength to-night
When I recount the warlike bands:
I have lost the sight of my eyes3
I am old, slow, and forlorn ἔ
The sound of all our strokes was heard
Like the burst of a billow in the day of the fatal storm2
Many were the arms and legs which were severed,
Many the limbs which keen-edged swords did mangle,
When the valiant of the people‚ pressed by strokes,
Sunk on the sward, never more to arise.

Son of my son ! said the king,
O Oscar, chief of the genereus youth ἵ
’ I saw the gleaming of thy sword,
And I gloried to see thee victorious in the battle³
Tread close on the fame of thy fathers,
v q And cease not to be as they have been.
’ ⁴When Trenmor of glorious deeds did live,
And Trathal the father of heroes,

They fought every battle with success,

 

wrath‚ consumed the sons of Lochlin?
