The MS. which accompanied Mr Anderson's let-
‚ter was stitched in the form of a very small memo-
randum book, abd consisted of two poems ; one on
Death, and another, a sort of heroic poem, in seve-

⁴ ral cantos, written, as appeared from some memo-

randums on one of its leaves, by Mr Maepherson,
when he taught a school in Badenoch. It contained
no evidence of the forgery of ι Offian, which Mr
ming suspested, nor indeed any other evidence con-
ne&ed with this subject, except in so far as it shewed
ΜΓ Macpherson to have been, as he says himself in
one of his'prefaceS, an early apprentice to the muses.
To shew what he had then acquired in such appren-
deelhip, a specimen of each poem is annexed in the
Appendix, ΝΟ. 6.

’ Mr Mssc'pherson's papers <called by him the ori-
gInal of Offian), above described, were left, as has
been said to Mr John Mackenzie, for the ‘purpose
of publication ; and it is now understood will be

publissied, as soon as some preliminary difficulties
can be overcome.
