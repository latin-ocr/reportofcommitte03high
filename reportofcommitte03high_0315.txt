δί· Myself, and my Faffier, and Gaul, were the three of
greatest prowess among the heroes.

, The error may have proceeded from mistaking Glomt
prowess, fof Clann childrem

Stunza ’7. “ ’Noavil si‘m bionan e s mac Cubhail
‘⁶ An riogh sin a bha air na Fiannibh
‘⁶ Dhefheudadh fir an domhain
‘⁶ Dol na Thallamhsan gun iaruidh.”
There is no word in the Gaelic langnage that bears the

,' 'most distant likeness to 'Noavil‚ which begins this quota-

tion. It is to be presumed from the English that is given
f'or it, Dost thou imagine, that the translator read, or took it,
for An Saoz'l. And if we read it so, the literal translation
of the passage is as follows—-
Dost thou imagine that he was equal to the son of
Cornhal ? ”

That king who was over the heroes of Finga-l.

All the men of the world might enter

Into his hall unbidden.

Instead of which it is thus rendered in the version of

Mr. Hill—*-“ Dost thou imagine that he is equal to the son

t ‘⁸ of Comhal ? ‘that king who ruled over the nations, who

“ defeated all the people of the earth, and visited their
‘⁶ kingdoms unsent for.'’

There seems but one way of accounting for so singular a
translation of a very plain passage. Mr. Hill had observed
(p. la), that he was “ inclined to suspect that there are in
’ “ the song of Der-mid killing the wild Βοαν, some words di-
“ rectly derived from the English, as Bheist, thri, ’δαῖθ’
‘It did not, perhaps, occur to him that the Gaelic 'beist and
tri wese synonymous with the bestia and tria of the Latin3
in whic'h they were known for a whole millennium‚ and we

know'not how much longer, before othe 'English languageff
