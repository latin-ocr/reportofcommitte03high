tention of the public.

Becket tells me that he is to give us a new edi-
tion of your Differtation‚ accompanied with some
remarks on Temera. Here is a favourable opportu-
nity for you to execute this purpose. You have a
just and laudable ze'al for the credit of these poems.
They are, if genuine, one of the greatest curiofities
in all respecta, that ever was discovered in the com-
monwealth of letter83 and the child is, in a man-
ner, become yours by adoption, as. Macpherfon has
totally abandoned all care of it. These motives call
upon you to exert yourself, and I think it were suit-
able to your candour‚ and most satisfa&ory also to
the reader‚ to publish all the answers to all the let-
ters you write, even though some of these letters
ss10uld make somewhat against your own opinion in
this affair. We {hall always be the more affured
¹that no arguments are stra'ined beyond their proper
force, and no contrary arguments suppreffed‚ where
such an entire communication is made to us. Beck-
et joins me heartily in this application3 and he owns
tome, that the believers in the authenticity of the
poems diminish every day among the men of sense
and reflection. Nothing less than what I propose
can throw the balance( on the other fide. I depart
:from hence in about three weeks‚ and should be
>glad to hear your resolution before that time.
