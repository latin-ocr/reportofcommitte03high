WHENGE come these dismal sounds that fin our ears 2
Why do the groves such lamentations send!
Why sit the virgins on the hill of tears,
While heavy sighs their tender bosoms rend!
They weep for Albin with the flowing hair,
*Who perish’d by the cruelty of Mey;
Ablameless hero, blooming‚ young, and fair3
Because 116 scorn'd her passions to obey.
See on yon western hill the heap of stones,
Which mourning friends have raised o’er his bones !

O woman 1 bloody‚ bloody was thy deed3
The blackness of thy crime exce—eds belief 3
