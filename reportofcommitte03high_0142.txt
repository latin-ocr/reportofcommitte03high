³Si1eum ar effid an· fhasaieh.‡
San hraich b’ionan do cheum
Is easaeh a leum thar ⁷eharraige,
Tra sgaoileas e cheo glas
Air gaothaibh, 'se bras ro Mhora.
Tha crainn is tuilm na glhacaibh
Gus am fairtlich a mhuir mhor air.

Of which his transsation is as follows ι

‘ Thy strength was like the strength of streams in their foam ;
*chy speed like 'the eagle of Atha, darting on the dun trembling
fawn of the desart. In battle thy path was like the rapid fall of
a mountain stt eam when {t pom-53 its white torrent over the rock,
and sends abroad its grey mists· upon the wings of the winds.
The roar of 1ts stream 18 loud through Mora’ s rocks, Mountain
trees, with all their mose and earth, are swept along between its
arms: but when it reaches the calm sea of the vale, its strength
is lost, and the noise of its course is filent. It moves not the
withered leaf, if the eddying wind doth not aid it. On eddying
winds let thy spirit be borne, son of Dui1‚1o to thy father83 but
light l'et the turf lie over thy beauteous form, and calm in th&=

grave be thy ssumber’
