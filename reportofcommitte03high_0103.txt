PoEMs OF osstAN. 77

With one of them, darkly seen, are his two dogs,
And his dim bow of yew is bem.—
From the {ide of the virgin comes a coloured stream,

Her robe is red, and her countenance mournful.—-

Till we behold the form of the two :
Do not roll, them together in thy embrace,
Nor scatter their beauty on the void.·—3

My foul is full of their song, ἱ
Like the soft sound of distant waves

In the season of calm.—-Their steps are near me.—
Children of Morna ! lovely to me is your song ;
Long hae its found been absent from the harps of Selma.’

And then he proceeds to relate the tragical story of
these children of Morna. ⁷
