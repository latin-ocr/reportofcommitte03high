304· AGCOUNT OF

part of' a poem on the death of Oscar. So that, notwitha
standing our MS. ascribes it to Fergus, it should seem to
have been generally considered as a genuine composition of
Ossian, in which F ergus was introduced as reporting the
disastrous issue of Cath Ghabhra to F ingal, in the poem
which relates the cause, and consequences of the death of
Oscar.
. 5. A poem by Allan Mac Rorie on the subjectos Diar-
mad’s death, corresponds in a great measure with one taken
down from oral recital in Sutherland, and another in Πᾶς ¹
the first communicated by Genera] Mackay‚ and the second
by· Robert Campbell Esq. advocate. But both the oral
editions are imperfect in their contents, and irregular in
their arrangement, and the Ila one has an interpolation of
Cuach Fhinm which is sometimes found engrafted on the
genuine Diarmad of Ossian.

6. Another by the same on the subject of Oscar’s death,

‚ .·.‘·. agrees, with some variation in words and arrangement, ,

with one: transmitted by Mr. M‘Lagan from oral recital, in
as far as this last extends, which is little more¹ than half the
length of our MS. edition.

⁴- 7. ⁷ Α poem (p. 236) on the death of Conloch‚ by Gille-
callum :mac yn ollaig‚ that is, Gilcolm, or Malcolm, the
0οη of the physicia'n, agrees very much with one got from
Ila as -above, and with another published by Miss Brooke*.
The Ila copy begins in the same way as our MS.
one. In Miss' Brooke's‚ the first eight verses of the
former, and the first twelve of the latter, are wanting.—
The whole three vary in the order3 and both Miss Brooke’s
and the Ila edition are continued beyond the conclusion of
the MS. one.

8. Α poem (p. 301) on the death of Fraoch by a lady

of the name of Mackeich, differs very little from Mr. J erom

stone’s edition inserted above, and still less from Mr. Gil-
Ρ Reliques of rrish Pom-y, p. 265,—-268.
