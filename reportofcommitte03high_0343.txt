MR. wrntxson’s PoETRY. 159

He stood, then sffeteh’d his sequte, all ποατ-,ἀ
Hang in. attention to the gratesul sound;

Down tow’rds the dust he bends his reverend head,
And to th' AJmighty supplicating pray’d 3·-

O Great Unknown‚ O ass—creating Mind„

In greatness Lost3 almighty uneonfin'd

To space or finite, whose mighty hand informs,
The rattling tempests and the sable stem-ns,
Absorpt in lightq O Vast Infinitude!
Incomprehensible ἔ supremely Good;

Attend, O Hea-v'nly! from thy glory hear,

And to a dust-form’d worm incline thy ear,
String the firm arm, and teach the hand to fighizff
Confbund the proud that strut in mortal might,
All owns thy may, ahd at thy great command
Success attends the weak and feeble hand.—
Thus said, the devout monarch suppliant bow’dff
And muttering prayers ran along the crowd.

In dazzling arms the chiefs terrific smne,

Glide thro the ranks, and form the lengthen’d'· line,-
While from th* imbattled foe a hero strode

A coat-ofimail hangs from his shoulders broad ;
On his higlhtow’ring head e-ventful wav'd

A crested helmet that the sabre brav'd ;-

On his left hand hen bears a spacious shieldff
Glitt’ring with ison terror o’er the field:

And in his* righ‘t he waves the shining blade.·
He greatly stood, and thus provoking said.,⁴

Ye Scots‚ ye nazion full* of fraud and guile,

Ye mean* descendants of a barren soil,

Let one advance (the bravest I demand) ’
And form a victim to my conquering hand}

F orget your fears, your wonted fears controu1‚
Le& fate enlarge the ever-little sonia—²
