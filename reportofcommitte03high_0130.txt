And stood ou't‘from among the people,

Between the man of might and the king,

The warrior of portly form advanced

With wrath and with strength toward them5

And, past us, he ruffied on the maid,

As she stood by the {houlder of ssingah

The son of Morni gave an eager cast

Of his firm spear, to stay him-

Noereak was the cast 3

It parted his {hield in twain.

Gaul of the glowing spirit rushed on,

To hew down the her-0, who stood as a ro‘ck of iee.
, Whoever should then behold them,

Furious would seem the strife of death.

The hand of Morni's son laid low

The king of Sora’s son—tale of grief Ῐ

Sad were our peopie for the coming of the maid,

On whose account the hero fell in dread affray.

,After the mighty had fallen

‘On ocean's strand, O deed 'of woe Ξ
The daughter of the king of the wave-surrounded land

Remained for a year in the land of Fingal.
, =We buried, by the fide of the water-fall,

The man of might and of prowess 3

And we placed on the point of each finger

A ring of gold, in honour of the king. ἒ*
