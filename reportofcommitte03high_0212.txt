Sm, A,
sometime before Ι was {az-ez, aed with yours
of November last, with fcegard ‘to the zu ti :tu iic ty of Os-
sian’s poems. Ι had a letter from M·- &exani-{er Mac Au-

lay, the Highland chaplain, upon {lie same subject. ἶ
then at his desire, set about examimng the original poems,
and the traditionary stories of Fingal. ancl his host3 and got
au within my reach who preserved on memory any part of
either. Thi's Ι found a work of some time and labour‚ but
could not without it answer your queri-es. ’

and Western Isles to be able to have collected the whole of
them3 for, as the works of Ossian are dispersed all over
the Highlands, there is not a elan, through whose lands
you travel, but you will find sorne one of these poems
among them, which is not to be met with any where eise.

The traditionary history of FingaL though much intermix-
ed With same, throw s a good deal additional light upon the
customs and manners of thos e remote times. The old High-
'la 2⁴1deis commonly entertained one another with the repeti-
tion of these poenis, and diverted the tediousness of the
winter nights. When they ⁴met to watch the dead corpse of ¹
their friends, they spent a considerable part of the night in
repeating the poems, and talking of the times of Fingal.
They often laid wagers on such occasions, who should re- “
peat most of the poems3 and to have a store of them on
memory, was reputed not a despicable acquisition. I know
