'in the breast of Mr. Hm, who thus expresses it in the· note
subjoined to it: ‘⁶ I suspect the expressions translated by
‘⁴‘ Maepherson, the kings <gf the world, are somewhat similar

“ to these. ’ Fingal is here represented as a Bacchus or
‘⁶ Sesostris.”

’ . Stanza 16. ⁶‘ Thug ezla air pronna'dh 1 &ir
“ San athlo air meoghair chon‚'' ’

Ι is translated, “ He who has been one day distributing gold,

‘⁶ and another following the toes of dogs’'—insteacl of

He passed one day in distributing gold,

And anotherdn following the sport of hounds.
It is possible the -misconception here was occasioned 'by the
translator’s 'being ignorant of the meaning of the word
meoghair, or meaghair, as it ought to be written. But as he
may not-have had the fortitude to acknowledge his ignorance,
he might read meoir (fin gers, or toes, of the human species)
for meoghair. He did not, perhaps, perebive that such a
reading was as flagrant a violation of the sound and quanti-
ty of the verse, as it was ,foreign to the idiom of the
language. ·

Stanza 18. ⁶⁴ Sgann achreideas me do sgettl
-‘² A Chlirich led leabhar bem
“ Gum bithidh. Fionn na chomh f hia-1
“ Aig Duine no aig Dia an lairnh.''
*The literal meaning of these *lines is this, ’
Ι can hardly believe thy tale,
> Thou Clerk with thy white book,
That Fingal‚ or any so genereus as he,
*should be under captivity either to God or -man.’'
The wide compass of Gaelic poetry does not contain a
sentence of plainer meaning than that which is before us.

ξ For pronnadh read bronnadb. The first, as lylr. Hm remarks in the
nnte, signifi& standing. The last means distiibuling. ·
