LETTER raom MR. POPE. 53

Δ 'was' out of regard to the memory of 1hat hero. I asked

“ ‘him if he thought that the spirit of that hero was present3
’, he said not; but he thought it well became them who de.-

‘scended from him to honour his memory. I have thus en-

³³¹ tertained you with the best accounts I can give you at pre-
⁴ sent of these warriors. If I had not been confined by the
gout I could go more minutely -to work ; but if a little

 

money was laid out in collecting what of these poems are ’

still extant, it would make a larger volume than the Te-

mora. If you think that it would be of any service to

'communicate a· part of this letter to Dr Blair, you are very

welcome3 and if I cau serve the Doctor in any thing
further, I shall, exert myself to serve him. I am,

Reverentl ancl D‘ear Brother, , . Ο
Your·very humble servant,
Amx. Pom.
