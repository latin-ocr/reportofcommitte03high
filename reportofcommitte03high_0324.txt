149 OBSERVATIONS

44 earth, though perhaps not ever strictly men, nor yet conf
‘⁴‘ stantly regarded as giants. Such are Odin, Thor, and the.
44 other Teutonic gods : such are Fingal, Oscar, and the
44 rest of the Fingalians among the ancient Scots : such also
44 are Hercules, Bacchus, and even Jupiter himself, with all
44 his sons and daughters, among the original Greeks; a Α
·“ people who agreed in many particulars, with our own
44 ancestors in northern Eur'opess.”

Mr. Hill, in his “ assumed character of a profest auth‘orss’
'made a discovery which had escaped. the notice of all other Ἰ
authors : For he found that Ossian’s heroes* bore a striking
resemblance to the followers of Mahomet in the monopo-
lizing of wives, and shutting them up =in a kind of Haram·
which they called a Castle. 44 This eastle stood in the isle
44 of Skye, and their women were confined ln it3 ⁴ For,
44 (said Mac Nab), they kept many women like the
44 Turks†.”

Never was ingenuity practised more successfully than it
was by ΜΓ. Mac Nab.· For what he told in pleasantry‚'
and in opposition to the current belief of his country, was'
told with so serious an air, that Mr. Hill believed it implig
citly3 and yet expressed a doubt of what he wrote him in
good earneet, as follows :

44 Sm,

44 Ι send you this copy of Ossian’s Prayers. Ϊ ι
’44 could give you more n0W‚ if I had time to copy them 'i ·
44 them I gave you was partly composcd, when they went
44 from their residence (in Cromgleann nan cloch) that is

44 Glenlyon Perthshire‚ to hunt to Ireland.
ALEx. M‘NAB.
