1323 COMPARISON

ΙΙ. MANos. The poems which bear this title, in the
collections of 'Miss Brooke and Mr Kermedy‚ differ very f

much 3 for the stanzas of Kennedy's edition, which extend ⁴ ’

· from the 47th to 'the 4‘9th, from the 52c1 to the 55th‚ and
from the 62d to the 74th inclusive, are not found, 8111181
in part or who]e‚ in the edition of Miss Brooke3 though
the style and sentiment prove them an undoubted offspring
of the ancient Gaelic muse. Of the first six stanzas of

stanzas above specified, and of the 7th3 which last is an

Along whose banks the heroes of Fingal used to hunt 2

Which abounded with red (1881· and elks !

The history of the two poems is likew 138 different. In
‘Miss Brooke’ s edition, Manos, king of Lochlin, after be-
ing disarmed and bound by FingaI, is set free by his gene-¹
rous conqueror, with ‘permission to renew the general sight,
or to retire with the vanquished host to his native landss'
He accepts of the latter proposal 'with pr'ofessions of grati?
tude, and ‘'em‘barks, after pledging his saith {hat he would
never list an {zrm against F ingal. The translation of Miss¹
Brooke expresses with elegance the sense and spirit of het*
