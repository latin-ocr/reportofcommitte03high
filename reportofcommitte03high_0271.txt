LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE. 87'

Δ1131151311011,11111011 110 had probably several editions of which
»the one would enable him to correct or amend the other.
I could, in many instances‚ account for the differ-enee by
‘the change of a single letter in words of a similar sound3
although Ι am far from thinking, that the translator attend-
⁸ed much to a scrup111011s exactness in his version. If my
letter had not been already long, and my sheet near full, 1
would have given you a version of a few passages of one
¹or two 111010 of the poems, particularly of the Β cttle of

 

Lora, although the edition of it too is very impeifect. 1
‚once had, and think I still have, an edition of that poem,
which I suppose is more correct. Ι wonder M r M'L.1est

ing the curious presents offered to Erragon, as they arc
translated by Mr M. When I can lay my hand.on my
copy, I may perhaps send you them, with a literal ver-

imperfect as it is, which I do not recollect to have noticed
before. The poet, after having confessed that half his
people fell in that battle, says, that if he were to swear by
the sun, he could not say that above a third of them escap-
ed. This looks as ⁴if the sun was *the object of his reve<-
rence or worship.

I was much disappointed in reading the poem, entitled
Clann Uilsneachain, (or Clann Usnothain) which Ι thought,
from the title, might be the original of Darthula3 but
which is so far short of it, 111 point of incident and
imagery, that Ι dox not think it is so much as a bad
edition of a poem which I heard long ago repeated
under the name cf Clamz Usnothain, and of which I
have since heard good judges speak in high terms, as
, the original of Darthula. The first part of the poem in
your possession, which seems to have little or no connec-
