LETTERs ⁷ro mi. BLAIR. · 1³7

lt* we suppose with others, that Ossian was cotemporary
with the Irish apeme, and converted by him to the chris-s
tian saith, the solution of your question is so much the
more easy. All the world will a110w,‘·'that the use of
letters was known in Ireland from St Patrick’s time; ancl
it must be aeknowledged that the sons of Erin were great-
ly interested in the preservation of Ossian’s works, as well
as the men of Caledonia. Therefore it may very reason-

would have committed to writing the compositions of that

myself seen more than one folio containing the works os
