Pons OF ossum. 67

Feeble was her voice, and few her words ;
I raised her up with my hand,
But she laid my palm on the head qfher son,
While her figh rose frequent.—
Dear child, vain is thy fondling,
Thy mother no more shall arise.

1 shall myself be a father to thee,
But Evirallin ²* is no more !'

The conclufion of the poem is in that dignified
stile of sorrow and of praise, which Fingal, whose
lamentation over Gaul it contains, is always repre-
sented, in the ancient poems, as uttering on the loss
of his friends.

‘ What is the strength of the warrior,
Though he scatter, as wither’d leaves, the battle?
To—day though he be valiant in the field,
To-morrow the beetle will prevail over him !’

‘ Prepare, ye children of musical strings,
The bed of Gaul, and his sun-beam † by him,
VVhere may be seen his testing-place from afar,
Which branches high overshadow‚
Under the wing of the oak of greenest flourifh,
Of quickest growth‚ and most durable form,
Which will {hoot forth its laves to the breeze of the shower,
While the heath around is still wither’d.
Its leaves, from the extremity of the land,
Shall be seen by the birds of summer,

'⁸ The wife of Offian,
† The common term fot a standard.
