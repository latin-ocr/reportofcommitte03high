66 REPORT ou THE

The broken found of thy name
From the mouth of Ogall, to speed thee Ξ-
But 1 fear thou wilt not return.'

Her perplexity between her defire to go to the as-
fistance of her husband, and her fear of leaving her
infant behind her in the boat, is described with in-
finite tendernesS‚ and concludes with a simile as ap-
propriate as it is beautiful. ¹

‘ She glanced by the scanty beam
On the beautiful face of her son,
When about to leave him in her nan-ow ss<iff.-—
“ Babe of my love ! be here unobserved !'’·-
As a dove on the rock of Ulacha‚
When gathering berries for her tender brood,
Retums often without tasting them,
While the havvk rises in her thoughts;
So returned three times Evinhoma,
Her soul as a wave that is toffed
From breaker to breaker‚ when the tempest blows‚
Till she heard a mournful voice from the tree of the shore?

The dying action of Evirchoma is a stroke of ma-
ternal tenderness not less expressive, nor less touch-
ing‚ for the fimplicity with which it is described.

‘ I lifted his helmet ς Ι saw his locks .
Disorder'd, uneven in sweat.
My cry arose,
And he raised with difficulty his eye.
Death came, like a cloud on the sun 3-
No more {halt thou see thy Oscar.
The beauty of Evirchoma is darken'd.

Her son, unconcern'd, holds the end of a spear.
