The* 1100111 in book the 4111Ἰ is handed down pretty entire-‘⁷
in this 0011111111, in which> each ‘of Fingal’s chiefs singles³
out the chief among the enemy he was to fight; leaving to’'
F umal the 110110111· of engagirig the king of Lochlin. The*
description ot the s'uh-beam', Fingal 5 standard, does' not

1 come up to the beau'ty 311(1 spirit of the original. Along·

with that of the sun-bearn, there 15 1111110 original a parti-¹
011131 description of the stantionis of the seven 11110011131·
chiefs of Fing-,al which 310 311 50 inimitably beautiful that
I cannot imagine how 111301111015011 has omitted them in his*
translation. Derm0d‚ who led the right hand of the army·
to that 1131110, (35 it is' e'xpresscd in th'e originaL) had a·
§tandard which, in magnificence, far exceeded the sun-'
1103111. Ηο 15, by the tradition of this 0011111117,ν said to be the
Predecessor of the Campbells.

W‘e have the poem containing the‘ battle of Lochlego,'
and 3 good pa'rt of> that selating the w‘ar of luis-thena, irs
page 104.

It would 13ςο 1111 too much 100111,311(1 I think it is not*
necessary that I go through 311 the poems in the 0011001100,Ι
of which we have pieces joined to other poems, and some-¹

one. Ι ¹

Mr Maepheffioii, in his 1011111ογ thr‘oug'h the Highl'andsss,³
put it upon me to look ou‘t for the poem called cath, or the*
1131110 of Benedin. 1113νο since got it, but not till after‘
„the book was published. The battle is‘ the {nost memo-‘
:rabie of F ingal’s exploits ; and, I humhly think, the poem*
is the most finished of Ossian’s 1101115.-

Upon the whole, I know not any capable of doin'g that-5
justice to the original, which Mr Maepherso'n h'as done.¹
0110111111ξέΓ I'm sorry for, his having omitted the descripss
