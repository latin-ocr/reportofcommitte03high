ἐϋ MACPHERsoN’s Momm-riom

has decayed greatly with the discouragernent of the bardsg ’
but that he never heard the authenticity of the poems of
Ossian called in question by any Highlander, and has no
doubt of their being the productions of the genius of Os-
sian, as firmly as he believes in the authenticity of any
other poems,⁴ or in the originality of any other work an-
cient or modern: That he never could have conceived that
any individuals could have the hardiness to put their own
sceptical conceits in opposition to the uniform tradition of
ages, and the unanimous and unwearied opinion of a whole
nation for many successive generations, of the authenticity ⁴
of these poems, and of the heroes celebrated in them, hav-
ing existed: and he does not believe it would be possible
for rnen who understood Gaelic well, to have any doubt on
this subject: That the declarant has no doubt that the Fin.. „
galians were Scotch Highlanders, but looks upon all-dis-
putes regarding the Era, and the particular scenes of action,
to be totally independent of the authenticity of the poems,
which he believes to have come down from remote antiqui-
ty‚ as firmly as he believes in his own existence: Th'at ,.
'some time Subsequent to the above excussion, he met Mr
James Maepherson at Edinburgh, and was presented by
him with a copy of F ingal : That he recollects to have read
a part of it, and to have been then of opinion, as far as he
could recollect the substance of the original, that this trans-
lation was well executed3 though the ablest that ever exist-
ed could not, in the declarant’s opinion, equal the original·
Gaelic by any translation.
