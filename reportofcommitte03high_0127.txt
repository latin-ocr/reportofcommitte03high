The Author qf this is Ossian.

θ Know ye a short tale of Fingal ξ
Α tale that claims your attention.
It concerns the son of Comhal of powerful sway3
Whom, while I live, Ι shall in woe remember.
We were few in his train,
By the fall of Roya, that softly murmurs,
When we saw a large sailed boat afar,
Which conveyed a fair over ocean.
Fifty alert heroes sat around the king ς
Trusty were their deeds in support of right.
How unlike‚ alas. ¹ are they whom I behold m your stead2
O ye, whose strength could controul each land Ι ⁴
We all stood up in haste,
Except Fingal himself, and Gaul,
To wait on the high bounding boat,
Whose course was parting the waves.
, It neither ssackened nor tested,
Till it entered our wonted haven.
It croffed the pool below the fall,
When out of it rose a daughter of youth.
*Brighter she shone than a bearn of the sun 5
Her air and manner exceeded her form.
In presence of the fair, who came from afar,
We all respessful stood.
She proceeds to the tent of Fingal,
And greets him in mufical accent.
The son of Comhal made suitable reply,
