OF PASSAGES. 227

:And though feeble be my effort to-day‚
I was second in the front cf the battle.
Like a flood-swelled torrent
Oscar bore dowr¹ che foe.
Like the sounding peal of the desart
Onward we spread in our path.
‘Like the gray rugged stones which bound from alost
Into the ‹xc-..lley of Lachne,
So descended our blows in the battle.
The strokes of Oscar hewing down the enemy,
Were heard like the lopping of green branches.

High-minded Gaul, who fights the battles of F in gal, [ger.,
Warrior of chosen steeds‚ bearing hardship and despisingdan-
Firm 1s the purpose of the chief ; conquest attends his combat.
High-bounding he is in valour, deadly in tumult3
Strong of arm in the warfare of kings.
Hero of piercing weapons, disabling bodies,
When he deals the battle of grievous ills.
The course of the kingly warrior
Is as the full-darting meteor.
By that hand of thiae, O frowning Gault
No man shall escape from it alive.
No captive taken from Gaul or Gara

Ullin-—spoke to the king of swords. ⁶⁶ Son of th& chief
of generous steeds! high-bounding king of spears l Strong
arm in every perilous toil. Hard heart that never yields.
Chief of the pointed arms of death. Cut down the foe ;,
let no white sail bound round dark Inistore. Be thi-ne arm
like thunder. Thine eyes like fire, thy heart of solid rock.
Whirl round thy sword as a j, meteor at night3 lift thy
shield like the flame of death. Son of the chief qs gene-rous!
