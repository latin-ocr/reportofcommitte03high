1²0th oF ossum. 61

This publication by Dr Smsth, if not impeached
in its authenticity‚ your Committee cannot but re-
gard as very strong evidence in the question submit-
ted to its consideration and inquiry; fince, in the
poems publilhed by him, are to be found not only
the same strain of high and impassioned poetry‚ but
also the same delicacy and refinement of sentiment
and feeling, which form so extraordinary a feature
in the poems transsated by Mr Macpherson. Of
some passages of one of those poems, ‘ the -Death *of
Gaul,’ the Committee will give a literal transsation,
which they think inferior to none of those given by
Maepherson, either in sublimity or tenderness. The
transsation is given line for line of the original,
which, to enable the Gaelic reader to judge of the
fidelity with which it is rendered, is inserted in the
Appendix, ΝΟ. 14. The argument of the poem is
shortly this: Fingal summoned his heroes for an ex-
pedition to the Isse of [frona. A flood in the river-
Strumon prevented Gaul from joining them in time ;
but he embarked in his ssiip alone on the succeeding
day. On his voyage, however, he paffed his friends,
who were returning with victory, unperceived, and
landed singly on the hostile shore. According to
the chivalrous idea of those times, he would not fly,
but struck his {hield as a token of defiance to the
issanders‚ against whom he fingly maintained a des-
perate conflict, till, fearful of a near approach, they
rolled a stone from above, which striking hiS thigh,
disabled him from moving, and there he was left by
his enemieS, dastardly alike and cruel, to pine ‘and

die.
