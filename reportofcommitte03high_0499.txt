tract made from Fol. XIII. rev. col. 2. is inserted. plate 3.
No. 3.

Luidh iaromh Columb Cille fecht ann gu Ri Cruithnech
.1. gu Bruidhi Mac milcon, agus do dunaclh dorus in
dunaigh fris, agus do foscuil fo chedoir glais iarnuidhi an
baili tre urnaidhthi Cholumb Chille. Tainic iar sin Mac
in n‘gh .1. Maelcu agus a Drui do frithtagra fri Columb
Cille tre geinn tlighecht. . ¹ Λ

The English is as follows :

After this Si. Columba went upon a time to the King
of the Picts‚ namely, Bruidhi son of Mildm, and the gate
of the castle was shut against him, but the iron locks of
the town opened instantly through the prayers of Columb
Cille. Then came the Son of the King, to wit, lVIaelchu
and his Drm'd to argue keenly against Columb Cille in
support of Paganism.

A form os letter somewhat ruder, and seemingly‘ later
by about a century than the foregoing, marks the last
piece in the volume, which is a tale much effaced. It
should seem from the following passage of it exlubited
plate 3. No. 1. that the isles of Iunsehorc, so frequently
mentioned in our ancient poems, were considered by the
author of it as facing Scythia; which makes it probable
that Shetland and Orkney were included in the name,
though the modern reciters of tales and poems usnally
consider it as applying only to the latter.
