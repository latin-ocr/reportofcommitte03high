· In answer to the first query, the committee will please to
know, thatabont the year 1740, I heard John Fleming, a
taylor² ‚who in the' manner of the country, worked with
his journeyme'n at my father’s house, repeat, in a kind οἱ
ghiming measureprheroio strains relating to an arrival or

landing'of an> host· and a subsequent battle, with· a-WsingXe
ᾗ eombat of. >two chiefs. t This I took down in writing, and
kept for some time3 but was not in possession of when
[ᾗ ’, Mt Macpherson's publications appeared. I had no doub†,
⁴³¹ however, in recognizing the same passage in the arrival of
Swaran, and the single combat with Cuchullin, in Mac-
³ phe'rson’s translation of Fingal.

The few words I can recal, are, lst, in relation to the

Δ [² hosts engaged:

“ Iomma celan, iomma skia, iomma tria, is luri gh
gharibh.

And in relation to the chiefs who grappled, and in whose
¹„ struggle— .

The Committee will be so good as excuse my spelling, and

² guess at the words as they best can. As John Fleming was
ἢ then an olch'sh man, he 15 probably long since dead.

As to the second query—the Committee will please to
know that I have, at different times, heard other scraps or
fragments repeated; but the principal use I made of them
was, to tell my friend and companion at College, Mr john

ζ, Home, that there were such relicks of ancient poetry in

ξ’

4³ the Highlands, and which led him to the inquiries which

produced Mr Maepherson’s commum'cations.

The fragments I afterwards saw in· Mr Macpherson’s
hands, by no means appeared of recent writing: the paper

> was much staiued with smol-ze, and daubed with Scots
'2 snuff.
