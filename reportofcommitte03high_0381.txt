And F iavi the son of the chace;

Em, son of Gara of the white knee,
And Caolt‚ the fairest, son of Ronan,
Rapid hero of the whitest side:

His side as the foam of the flowing sea,

“ When the wind pours it on the beach along with the drifted

Fraoch, also, the liberal son of Feuo‚ [snow.
Suga‚ the guardian shield of fame3
And the excellent son of the sea-skirted Lucar's king,
Cormac of the well-fashioned' ships. ⁸

“ Son of Cairbar from the red tree ἔ ¹
Bring speedily by the sounding call of thy voice,
The fierce bzmds, not fierce at home †.”

Such is the coming of the heroes,
As the roaring wind when it brushes athwart the lofty moun-
Like the noise of streams rushing in cataracts, ⁷ [tain.
Their tread is heard afar.
Bright is their face in the armour of their kindred,
Which distant gleams on the dusky heath.
⁷ Their men followed, along the hill,
To conquest or to death, like a ssight of sea fowls.
’ The sound of battle from shields rearedon high,
Ascends alost in air.

“ Is echoed from the towering rocks.

equal bursts the song of battle. Rocking Cromla echoes
round. On Lena’s dusky heath they stand, like mist that
shades the hills of autumn.; when broken and dark it
ael-{les high, and lifts its head to heaven 2
