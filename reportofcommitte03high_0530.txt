‘⁶ Teatful, doleful, is the semin of the Fingaiians,
Deploring the mighty warrior of pleasant smile5
Mournful, sad, does Fingal lament thee
Who shalt be seen no longer in the hall of heroes !

‘⁶ Unfortunate was the death of the valiant cham-

pion,
Who fell without war, in a duel.
Like a cloud of night he departed from us ;
Sad is the tale we are left to {noum Ξ
“ The maids of Sora will raise the strain of woe,

ἱ On account of the fair and lovely youth 3

As the mountain mist is ‚each tendet fair,
Dropping tears‚ as she wails with stifled voice.
‘⁶ The hero, vigorous, strong and tall,
Is now without motion, arms, or dress.
N arrow and level is the place of thy repose,
On ‚the margin of the meadow--Great is our wound of
woe !
“ Upon the pebbly strand thou didst constantly move,
On the boisterous„ white-foaming ocean 3
Musical‚ melodicus in the field,
In the time of hunting the full grown deer.
‘⁸ 0! hero mild, chearful, beloved‚
Eloquent, vigorous, active, expert to wound ;
Like a strong stream amongst enemim,-
Fareweu, beloved of the sharp blades !”
