64' REPoRT oN *1⁴de

Sounding boss of battles ἔ
Gladdening to me is thy found ;

It awakes the days that have pass’ed,
And in spite of age my foul bounde-

or, ’

or,

As the wind awakes the flaming heath of the mountains, Ξ

Like the stream of the moqntains my foul bounds *ζ J
But far from me be the thoughts of war 3
My spear is become a supporting staff ;
My boffy shield no more shall it strike.--
But what found is this that has awakened it ?
A piece of a shield worn with age,
Like the waning [black-edged] moon its form.
The shield of Gaul it is,
The shield of the companion of my excellent Oscar--a-
But what is this that has saddened my foul ἓ
Often, Osear, hast thou received thy fame ;
The partnex· of thy love {hall now be the subje& of song}

Oh, Malvina, with thy harp be near Ρ

The description of Evirchoma witneffing the dec-

parture of her husband, is equally pfflmresque and
natural.

‘ In the light ship of rough waves
The hero followed us on the second morning.—
But who is she on the rock, like mist,
L'ooking through tears on Gaul ?
s Her dark hair wanders on the wind,
And her soft hand, white as foam, surrounds her foreloelkf
