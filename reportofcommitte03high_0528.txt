TRANSLATION.

IN the house of Temora of melodious cruits
As we were engaged in drinking,
Mutual provocation roused to wrath
Carril, the graceful hero, and Momad the great.
The ehampions rose to wresfie,
Heavier than lead was the pressure of their feet 3
Afar was heard the panting of their breasts3
While sad in suspence stood the heroes of Fingal.
Stones and heavy earth
Were dug up by their heels in strife‚
Whilst they struggled during the day
Without determining which was the best iu deeds of
strength. ’
On the morning of the second day,
The champions engaged again,
Carril of the pointed arms of victory,
And Gaul of the keen tempered swords.
Folded in each other’s grasp,
They anxious twined‚ and pulled and turned,
Tin opposing arms to arms in perilous contest,
The sound of their strokes was regretted by all,
Often did fire come from their arms
And wrought foam from their white breasts 3
Their tough spears were hacked
And their shieIds² hewn down to the ground.
