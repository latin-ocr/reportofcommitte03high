The Author φ( this is Ossian.⁴

*ἕ Long do the clouds this night surround ηις-ε
Long to me was the night that is past-
For the day that is come Ι haverl'ong''ed--·⁴
While ssowly rol'l'ed the day before.
Tedious to me is each day that come8‚
For it is not as it was wont !
Gone are the heroes, my friends in war,
And feats of strength are no longer performed ε
Generofity, the will and the deed have failed.
sad is my heart without a‘n obje& for its* love,
Nor power' to avenge the feeble.
Hospitality and the drink of the feast are no more ³
No more the love of the fair or of the chace,
In which I was wont to take delight.
On the sword or the dart I no longer rely.
1 do not come up with the hind or the hart'5
Nor do Ι traverse the hius of the elk.
I hear not o'f Bouhds nor their deeds.
The night of clouds to me is long !
