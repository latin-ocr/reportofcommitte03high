person has left so little vestige behind. It was a language
spoken iii the 'cottage‚ but not in the parlour, or at the
table of any gentleman. Its greatest elegancies were to
be learned from herdsmen or decr-stealers. It was con..
nected with disaffecdon, and proscribed by government.
Schools were erected to supplant it, by teaching a different
language. There were no books in it, but the manuals of
religion, and these in so aukward and clumsy a spelling
that few could read them. The fashionable world in the
neighbourhood, as usual, derided the tone and accent of
Highlanders‚ believing their own to be models of elegance
and harmony. It was more gentee'l to b'e ignorant than
knowing of what such a language contained; and it re-
quired all the genius, learning, and courage of James Mac-
pherson, to perce'ive and affirm that the ancient strains of
Gaelic poetry might compare with those of other nations
more celebrated. If it should still remain a question with

Ἴ many, whether he collected or composed these strains, Ι

shall not be surprised; for I believe, that what he got in
writing was unknown to those who gave it, and the merit
of what was repeated' scarcely felt. And, 'in short, that he
himself at times was not averse to be thought the author
of what became so much celebrated and admired through-
out Europe.

In writing so much, and so little to the purpose of the
Committee's letter, I trust to your usual favour and good
nature in helping me to the proper excuses 3 and am,'with
the most sincere and perfect regard,

My Dear Sir,
Your most obedient, and
most humble servant, ⁴
ADAM FERGussoN.
