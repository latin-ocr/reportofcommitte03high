torical documents and records‚ which the antiqua-
rian looks for in vain among any archives or collec-
tions of antiquities in Scotland. q It is observable,
however, that most of the copies of the ancient Fin-

as given by her, which bears a close affinity to the Borbar and
Fainasollis† of Inacpherson, there is a passage fignifying that
the foreign hero rode over the sea on a magical horse. (Me‘ss
