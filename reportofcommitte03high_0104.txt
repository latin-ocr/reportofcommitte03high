78 REPORT ON THE

terms 3 that the persons themselves had never doubt-
ed of the existence of such poems as Mr Maepher-
fon had transsated ε that they had heard many of
them repeated in their youth ε that listening to them
was the favourite amusement of Highlanders, in the
hours of leisure or of idleness; but that, since the
Rebellion 1745, the manners of the people had un-
dergone a change so unfavourable to the recitation
of these poemS‚ that it was now an amusement
scarcely known, and that very few persons remain-
ed alive who were able to recite them. That many
of the poems they had formerly heard were fimilar

⁴ in subject and story, as well as in the names of the

heroes mentioned in them, to those transsated by Mr
Maepherson: that his transsation seemed, to such as
had read it, a very able one 3 but that it did not by
any means come up to the force or energy of the
original 3—to such as had read it 3—-for his book was
by no means universally poffeffed or read among
Highlanders even accustomed to reading, who con-
ceived that his transsation could add but little to their
amusement, and not at all to their conviction, in a
matter which they had never doubted. A few of
the Committee’s correspondents sent them such an-
cient poems as they poffeffed in writing, from hav-
ing formerly taken them down from the oral reci-
tation of the old Highlanders who were in use to re-
cite them, or as they now took them down from
some person, whom a very advanced period of life,
or a particular connexion with some reciter of the
old school, enabled still to retain them in his memo-

ry;
