The most formidable objections that have been urged
against the authenticity of Ossian⁷s poems, are those that
are founded, or pretended to be founded, on history3 so

- that, besides getting answers to the printed queries, even

if these should be satisfactory, it would be necessary to
employ considerable historical research, in order to answer
such objections. You mention one made by Gibbon.
Whether he may be right or wrong in his assertion‚ (for
ν. his assertions are not always to be trusted,) I have no op-
portunity of examining: at any rate, I think Ossian is
clear of this objection3 for the Gaelic word is obviously

Ἰ an epithet‚ (signifyingfierce-eye,) and might be as appli-

cable to any other as 10 the emperor Caracalla. If Mi·

ν’ Μ’- in appiying this epithet to Caracalla, should be

, found in a mistake, as Ι apprehend he is in this, and in.
one or two similar cases; his mistakes‚ in my opinion,
make rather for than against the authenticity of the poenis,

’ as a forger would not, by his own unnecessary commenta..

ries or conjectures, abstract from the credit of his text.

Which does not appear credible, even from many passages,
of Ossian :- so that Mr M’- may have been mistaken
