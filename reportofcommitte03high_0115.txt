ΡοΕΜε OF oss1AN. 87

produce the book which Mr Macpherson seemed de-
firous to confign to oblivion. Having arraigned
Maepherson at the bar of the public, as one of the
first literary impostors' m modern times, I have im-
posed an oppofite obligation on his friends to vindi-
cate and rescue his memory‚ if they can, from the
imputation of forgery3 after which no reason can
'be affigned for withholding the book, but that it
,would serve for his conviffion. Such is the plain

ι state of the fa& 3 and if his friends are not at liberty

to produce the book, the only circumstance that
could suppose an obligation to suppress it, is, that it
would serve sor his deteffion. Very poffibly it con-
tains nothing ’to the purpose ·; but the »book would

⁷ have been produced long ago, had ‹it afforded a fin-

gle proof of the authenticity of Offian 3 and, in the
impartial publications of the Highland Society‚ no
part of the evidence should appear to be suppreffed.

Ῑ do not mean by this, that the bools-aitself should
be published‚ but that it should be transmitted to the
Highland Society for public inspeffion ; otherwise
Ι must conclude that a part of,the evidence, the most
injurious to Maephers0n‚ *has ‘been -withheld by his
friends. Ι am,¹ my Lord‚ with respe& and esteem,
your Lordship’s most obedient humble servant,

MALeoLM LAING.'
