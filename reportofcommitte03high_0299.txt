01·- Tm: 0R1G1NAL. 1 15

” He seized the mountain ash by the top,
And tore a branch from the trunk‚

But as he was taking his steps toward land,
The rouzed monster observed him.

Overtook him as he was swimming,
And grasped his hand in its gaping gorge.
Fraoch seized the monster by the jaw3
Would Fraoch had now his dagger Ξ ., 4·

The monster mangled his bosom fair,
And gnawing tore his arm away. ¹
The white-handed maid went in haste,-
Bearing a dagger which proved of no avail.

The' conflict was but a conflict of short continuance

His hand still held by its head: 7
Woful was the end of the strife
Between Fraoch, son of F iach, and the monster.

They fell sole to sole,
At those brown stones on the shore :
Which as the gentle maid beheld,
She fen on the beach a cloquf mist. *²

WVhen she awoke from her torpor,
She took his softened hand in hers,
⁴‘ Though you be to night a mangled prey for fowlss,
Great is the deed you have performed. ”

‘ An expression frequent in the Gaelic for-swooning or sainting.
