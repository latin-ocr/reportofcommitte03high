DAoL, who was watching the ocean
When high heaved its bssIows,
Hastened to relate what occurred.
“- Arise, King of Taura!
Ι see a great fleet3 I proclaim
That our harbours fare covered with crowds
From the mighty fleet of the sea-borne foe.
If this be the Garve, the son of Starn0‚
That terrible meteor destructive in its course,
He shau bear our captives over sea,
Nor can the king of full-grown warriors prevent him.’⁸
⁶⁶ Thou art deceived to-day‚ as thou always art3
It is the fleet of the hills that is there,
And the heroes of Fingal coming to our aid.‘’
. ⁶⁶ Their chief dexterous in arms,
Is a rock bending over our shore.
I beheld the hero like, a spreading mist.
[Tan] he seemed as a pine of the forest,
‘In the array of the hosts, close waving
Like the grass that is moved by the gentle breeze.

 

⁶⁶ Moran !” replied the blue-eyed chief, “thou ever trem-
mest, son of Fithil! Thy fears have increased the foe.
Itis Finga1‚ king of desan-ts, with aid to green Erin of
‘⁶ streams.'‘

‘⁶ Ι beheld their chief ’⁹ says Moran, “tall as a glittering·
, rock. His spear is a blasted pine.—-He sat on the shore!
like a cloud of mist on the silent hill !

‘⁶ Many, chief of heroes! I said, many are our hands of
war. W ell art thou named the Mighty BIan: but ma..

northern nations to distinguish persons by descriptive epithets, The Nor-
wegian Sigurd was named Digri, or the Thick. William King of Scots bore
the synonymous epithet of Ga rbh: and Canute, who ruled over Denrnark,

England, and Nom ay, is innon-,n in the xer ses of sighvat his Scald, by the
title of Di mgni
