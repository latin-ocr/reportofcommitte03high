4 LETTERS 'ro DR. nLAniss

abandoned me along with the sceptics long ago. But· after
wondering at his‘absurdity, who has it‘in his power at once
to put the matter beyond a question, I doubt much whether
any other man can do it. All the manuscripts of conse-
quence are in his hands; and he alone knows from what
parts of the Highlands, and srom what persons, he col-
lected them. By obtaining these from him, and procuring
certificates from the persons in whose possession they have
formerly been, and comparing them with the translation,
something might be done : but I have little hopes that any
manuscripts will be found in the Highlands, which have
not already fallen into his hands. These Islands never were
possessed of any curious manuscripts, as far as Ι can learn,
except a few which Clanranald had, andv which are all iu
hiacpherson’s possession. The few bards that are lest
among us, repeat only detached pieces of these poems. I
have often heard, and understood them ; particularly from
one man called John Mac Codrum, who lives upon my
estate of North Uist. I have heard him repeat, for hours

together, poe-ms which seemed to me to be the same with ⁷

lvlacpherson's translation3 but as I had it not along with
me, and could not remember it with sufficient exactness, I
cannot positively affirm that what I have heard is precisely
the same with the translation. As I made no doubt of its
being the same, Imight also, on that account, give less
attention to discover any small differences. The man
whom you mention, by the name of John Ossian, lives in

Hams. I have heard nothing of him since I came last to ' Α

this country; but was told, when Ι was here before, that
he could repeat more of these poems than any man in these
Islands. Ι shall contrive to get him, and the other man I
mentioned to you, examined in the way you propose, in .
presence of some people who are proper'judges, and get a

faithful report of the result of this trial. I arn sorry my ¹
own engagements will not allow me to remain long enough
