114 LITERAL TRANSLATION'

She sent a message to Fraoch‚
And the hero enquired what was her wish2-.›

She replied, t'hat she could not be whole,.
Unless she got the full of her delicate hands
Of the fruit of that cold l'ake,

’ Pulledv by no othefman than maoch.-

“ Fruit was I never employed to gat-her,
Said Fiach's son, with blushing face 3· ¹
But though I have not hitherto, added Fraoch,=
I will now go to pull fruit for Meyv.”

s Fraoch departed with unpropitious steps>
,πί And ptoceeded to swim on the lake ς·-
ἷ He found the monster fast asleep,

And its jaw open to the tree.

Fraoch, son of Fiach, of arms keen,
Came from the monster unobserved,
Carrying an arm-full of ‘thered‘ fruit
To the place where Nseyv was longing for it.

“ Though good be that which you have done9

:said Meyv of the whitest bosom,
Nought will relieve me, genereus champion ἔ
But a braneh torn from the trunk.·”

Fraoch, the youth who knew not sear,

Went again to swim the soft lake 3
But he could not5 how great soe’er his suceesssr

Escape from his allotted death.
