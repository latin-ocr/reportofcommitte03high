88 REPoRT ON THE

.‘ SIR, Killihuntly‚ 30th May, 1892.

‘ I have to apologize for having delayed so
long to answer your favour of the llth of Apris,
respeffing M'r Laing's application for the manuscript
poems of the late Mr J ames Maepherson‚ in my pos-
seflion3 but circumstances not necessary to mention -
put it out of my power to make the. proper reply to
you sooner. ’

From principle, and· from inclination, I am a
friend to truth‚ and to liberal and ingenious inqui-
ry; and, fo far from having any with to withhold
information from Mr Laing on this subject‚ I should
willingiy aid him in his researches, were it in my
power to do so, whilst he investigates the question
with the learning of a scholar, and the candour of a
gentleman. Without wishing to take any {hare in
a subje& of dispute on which Ι have long formed a
decided opinion for mystis, I transmit you the ma·-
nuscript by my young friend Mr George Maepher-
fon, Invereshie‚ to be used as you please. I believe
it can throw no light on the subje6³c3 but you can
best judge whether it is proper to be communicated
to Mr Laing or otherwise. ¹ Had it been either given
to me confidendassy, or come into my hands as one ⁸
of ΜΓ Maepherson’s 'executors‚ it should never have
been produced by me; butI feel 'no reluCtance in
'giving it up to you, as accident alone put it in my
possession, many years before I had any acquaint-

ance
