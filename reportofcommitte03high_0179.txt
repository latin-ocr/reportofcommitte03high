On the whole, the Committee beg leave to
REPORT,

That there are two questions to which it has di-
re&ed its inquiries, on the subje& which the Socie-
t⁴y was pleased to refer to it, and on which it now
submits the best evidence it has been able to pro-

' cure.

lst, What poetry, of what kind, and of what
degree of excellence, existed anciently in the High-
lands of Scodand, which was generally known by
the denomination of Ossianic‚ a term derived from
the universal belief that its father and principal com·
poser was Offian the son of Fingal ?

ΞΑ, Q pub-

 

As to the first of those questions, the Committee
can with confidence state its opinion, that such poe-
try did exist, that it was common, general, and in
2 great abundance3 that it was of a most impreffive
and striking sort, in a high degree eloquent, tender‚
and sublime.

The second question it is much more difficult to
answer decifively. The Committee is poffeffed of

210 documents‚ to ss1ew how much of his colleffion
