SPECIMENS oF

He said, and tage in tickling poison ran'

Thro’ ev'ry soul‚ and stung each gen’rous man}
The hunter heard, rage ¹sparkled from his eyes,
And from his inmost soul the hero sighs,

Then thus indignant spoke, Ah! glory gone?
Ah antient virtue, now for ever flown Ε

What blessed corner does thy godhead rest?

No more you swell the gen’rous Scottish breast, ”
When thus, O scotland, Saxons dare deride,
Thy steel-clad warriors ranged side by side.

I can no more 3 my panting vitals swell‚

I'll give thee glory‚ or thy soul to hell:

‚ Then tow’rds the foe the youth* indignant moves,

Fear trembles‚ en’mies praise‚ and envy loves.
He strides along the men-inviron'd ground,
His rattling arms emit an iron sound.

The Saxon saw, advanc’d‚ nor look'd behind,
Fate hurried on, and courage steel'd his mind 3
Bright in effulgent arms the youths appear’d,
Each o'er the plain a steely column rear'd,
They rush together, clashing arms afar
Reflect the horrors of the dismal war;

Awful the blades wave gleaming in the sky,
And from the crashing steel the sparkles fly.-

Α They fight, and wearied cease, and fight again,

Their feet bake dust with blood upon the plain.
Death undetermin'd‚ points to each his stings‚

And conquest flutters round on dubious wings.

The hill-born youth reminds with anxious care,
What vaunts the foul-mouth’d Saxon breath'd on air.
His country's love the youthful hero wams,

And vengeance strung his almosst wearied arms,
Uprais’d aloft the light-reflexive blade‚

Sings thro' the air, and cleaves the saxon head,
