into any elaborate argument or discuffion on the au-
thenticity of those poems‚ or to examine, with cri·

every part of the Highlands‚ in colleffing what ma-
terials or information it was still prafficable to col-
le&‚ regarding the authenticity and nature of the
poems ascribed to Offian, and. particularly of that
celebrated collection publiffied by Mr James Mac-
