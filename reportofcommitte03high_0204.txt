20 LETTERS ΤΟ DR. BLAIR.

from the translation3 Fingal‚ book iv. pages 49, 50, ans}
51. ,

Neil M‘Murrich‚ a native of this country, who with
his predecessors for nineteen generations back have been
the bards and historians of the family of Chanranald, (it
being customary with every Highland family of note to
have bards and historians of old5) repeated before me the
whole of‘the poem of Darthula, or Clan-Usnoch, with few
variations from the translation, which he declared he saw and
read, together with many more, in a manuscript which
underwent the same fate with the manuscript already made·
mention of. Declared also, that he is of opinion, the last
poem in the collection, Berrathon, is contained in a manu-
script which Issmyself saw him deliver, with three or four
inore, to Mr Maepherson, when he was in this.. country,
and for which Mr Maepherson gave him a missive, oblig-
ing himself to restore it, which shows that in the opinion
>of both, the manuscript contaIned something of great im-
portance. John Ossian is yet alive in Harris, and wasto
be transportcd to the Isle of Sky, as I was eredibly in-
formed, to be examined by ΜΓ James Nicolson, minister
of Durinish, otherwise Ι would have got him examined.-
Though all that I have above offered will, I sear, be of
little consequence 'towards promoting your undertaking 3,
yet Ι hope that other Highlanders, better qualified for the
purpose, will furnish you with as many testimonies, for
the authenticity of these poems, as will enable you to estab-
lish with the world the credit due to them. As your con-
cern for truth and for the honour of your country, justly
entitle you to the thanks and good wishes σέ all your coun-
trymen‚ be pleased to accept of mine, and believe that Ι
arn, with great esteem,

Reverend deas brother,
Your affectionate brother, and
most obedient servant,
Aucus MAG Nixus,
