150 REPORT oN THE

of the poems, indeed, particularly those of an ΞΠ· ·

ferior and more corrupted class, speak of the spoil
to be acquired by the conquerors3 but it seems to
*have been more a mark of superiority, or an ac-
knowledgment of subjeffion, than the fruit of pil-
lage3 and inhumanity to the conquered and the
captive is never supposed to be a legitimate use of
victory.

In confidering this matter, the Committee begs
leave also to suggest, that some allowance ought al-
ways to be made for the colouring of poetry‚ on the
manners and sentiments of the heroic persons of
whom it speaks. ,VVIfUQMffiaQ -or whoever VQQho
‘composed the poems in question, had that humanity
and tenderness which are so generally the attendants
on genius, he might, though he could not create
manners of which there was no archetype in life,
''transfuse into his poetical narrative a portion of ima-
ginary delicacy and gentleness, which, while it flat-

ters the feelings of the poet himself, gives at the '

same time a dignity‚ a grace, and an interest to his
picture.
