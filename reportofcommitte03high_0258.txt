*ι’-ι LETTERS To Mn. MAcxsssz.

became a student in philosophy, when, in the year 1766
or 1767, I read Mr Macpherson's translation, with which, ·
beautiful as it is, I was by no means‘ so much charmed as
I had been with the oral recitation of such as Ι had heard
of the poems in the original language. The elegance of
*the modern dress did not therefore, in my opinion, com-
pensate for the loss of the venerable and ancient garb. Q

reading the translation, Ι recognized a number of poems,

episodes‚ and passages, which were familiar to me. Some
of the poenis, ancl parts vof poems, were, however, new

considerable merit, I desiderated. Of a number of these

that ΜΓ Maepherson himself would soon publish them.
When this however became doubtful, I remember to have
formed the design of collecting as many as I could of his
originals, which at that time would not be a few: but
finding there was no encouragement to be expected for such
a work, and that those which I had already collected
would not defray their own expence, nor have been ever
published had it not been for the liberal support and paq
tronage of the Highland Society of London, Ι gave up the
pur-suit of Gaelic poetry3 about which I became so care-
less, that I never took the trouble of transcribing or pre-
serving several pieces that had fallen into my possession}
Some I lost, some I gave away, and some still meet me in
the bosom of this, or the other hook. Had I had the second
szght to foresee that such things would one day be in re-
quest‚ Ι might have now had many, In the original
poems and translations which I had published, I had occa· ἲ
sion to introduce se‘veral passages of Mr Maepherson's ori-
'ginals into the notes; for, without searching for them, I

had got considerable portions of several of those poenis
