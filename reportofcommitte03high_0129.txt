POEMS oF oss1AN. 101,

A close helmet burnished round the head

Of the dauntless man of strength 3

A black-ribbed {hield on his arm,

whose field was marked with figured sports.

A huge and maisy sword

Was fixed on the fide‘of the mig-luy,

Over whose hilt he sportful exercised,

As he approached our people.

Two javelins, winged with death,

Stood in the hollow of his ffiield.

For strength, for prowess, and for might,

The 'hero matchless seemed.

A noble air and king-like eye

Marked his manly face ς

Fresh was his bloom, and white *his teeth,

Β As he rode the founding surge in his speed.

, To land he bounded in his course, Ι

Nor did he regard the ptoffer of Fingal.

Our fifty heroes then present,

Whose deaths were in his soul,

Dreaded the fate of the man so bold ofdeed‚

Nor was there a hero of us unu-oubled in thought.

Off his wave as -he came to land,

The far famed king djd ask,

“ Do you know, O maid,

.If that be the man you spoke of ?”

“ I do know, son of Comhal 3 O Fingal Σ

Much barm, I fear, he will do thy people3

He will attempt to bear ine away,

Though great he ,sthy might, generous Fingal.’'

Oscar θ’* and Gaul started from their Ρὶᾶςέ,

Heroes fieree and vietorjous in conrfliR,

G 3 And
