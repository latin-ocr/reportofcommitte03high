LETTERS TO MR. MAcKENznt. Sl.

turn to you with such a version as you wanted, before I
left town, for which the best apology I can make is, to

send them now.
The following lines are taken from the poem entitled‚

“ Cath Fhinn ugus Mhanois ; from the recitation of Galum
Van Raodhair. ’⁵ ,

ORIOENAL.
Chuir sinn Deo-greine ri crann,
Bratach F hinn bu ghairge treis,
Lomlan do chlochaibh an oir,

⁷‘S ann leinne bu mhor a neas.
Iomadh claidheamh dom-chrann οἱΠι,Α
Iomadh srol ga chur ri crann,
An cath mhic Cumhail nam fleadh
’S bu lionmhor sleagh os ar ceann.

mmmm> VERSION.

We set the sun-bearn to the pole,
The standard of Fingal of stoutest might5
Full-studded with stones in gold;
With us it was held in high respect.

Many were our swords’ with fist-guards.
Many the standards rear'ed on poles,
In the battle of the son of Cumhal of feasts,
And many the spears above our heads.

After observing that the different editions of all these
poems differ greatly from each other, (as may well be sup-
posed, when they were left to the mercy of oral recitation)
and that it is hardly fair to judge of Mr M.'s translation
without having his own edition, I shall here subjoin his
version of this passage, as it is in FingaL b. iv. p. 57, of
¹ th‘e first 4to edition.
