should rather say of the original transsated there, and
I communicate to you a few stanzas, taken from the
manuscript.

⁶ Bha fer re fer, is-cruaigh re cruaigh,
Sgiatha fuaimneach‚ daoine air lar,

Dh'eirigh agus theirin gach laum
Ghluais Goll mar cha-om osaig on astd,
Gun ghlan e saoighin as
Bha Sam-an mar chaoir fas-'aich than,
Am fraoch fuaimar Gorm-mheass bras.
Aeh cia mur ehuiram fios le fonn,

, Βέιε trom na n sseagh bha ann ?
Bu sex-athon stri bha san bhlzzr,
Bu laffaeh ard mo lanu.
Bu scrathoil Osgar mo mhac sein,
Thar each bu treubhach maith ἔ

Bha selas balbh am bhroilleach ihuas3 Ι
Bhi ghruaigh mar chaoir † san chath. ³ ’Ἆ“ῤ

Ἆῤ The literal transsation of the above passage is as follows :

Man was opposed to man, and steel to steel‚
Shields founding, men falling ; ξπ» , ⁶ V
Like hammers of hundreds on the son of the embers
Swords rose and fell. ¹
Gaul went on like a blast §escendiug from the height,
A& he destroyed heroes. Ἣ ¹
Saumn was like a flame of the desert,
That consumes the founding heath of Gormal.
But how {hall I relate in song
The heavy death of spears that was there ?
Terrib'oe was the strife of battle.
High flamed my sword.
¹ Terrible
