LETTERS To DR. BLAIR. sst

the skill and dexterity of his men in working them, and
their intrepidity in the greatest storms—of which he gives·¹
the most striking description. I can account for it no other
way than his having been born in Badenoch, one of the
most inland parts of this kingdom, ‘’ffbere not having ac-
cess to be acquainted with that kind of‘fmagery, he did not
therefore perhaps understand the original poems.

With regard to the authenticity of the poems, they were,
by the traditions of* our forefaffiers, as far back as we can
‘trace them, ascribed to Ossian, and to the most remote pe-
riod of time, of which we have any account. It is a word
commonly used in the Highlands to this day, when they
express a thing belonging to the most remote antiquity, to
> call it, f iountachk, i. e. belonging to the time of Fingal.
I know not a country in the Higfflands, which has not

. places that are famous for being the scenes of feats of arms,

strength, or agsssty, of some of the heroes of the race of
F ingal. However much the several clans differ in the tra-
ditionary history of their respective farnifies, they are
all agreed, as far as ever I could leam, with respect to the
genuineness and authenticity of Ossian's poems.

But the most effectual method, I presume, of satisfying
the doubts of the gentlernen who deny Highlanders the ho-
nour of these monuments of the genius and prowess of
their ancestors‚ is to invite them to the Higfflands, and to
bring interpreters along with them, that they may eka-
mine the matter themselves. You may assure ’1116111 of a
hospitable reception ; and wherever they go to, the gentle-
111611 and clei-gy will find out to thern the old men who still
have in memory most of the works of Ossian‚ and the
traditionnry history of the FingalianS. I would engage
that they should return home sufficiently satisfied that these
poems belong to the time and country to which they are
ascribed. If any other material question occurs to you.
