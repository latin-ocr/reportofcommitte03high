'74 REPORT ON THE

This ‘ Address to the Sun in Carthon' the Com-
mittee was the more solicitous to procure, and to
lay before the Society‚ because it was one which
some of the opposers of the authenticity os Offian's
poems had quoted ass evidently spurious, betraying
the most convincing marks of its being a close imi-
tation of the address to the sun in Milton.

The Committee will quote another extra& from
this publication of Dr Smith's, which exhibits a ten-
derness of a different kind. It is part of the lamen-
tation of Graiae, on the death of her lover Dargo,
supposed by her to have been killed by a boar.

⁴ Mar

comest forth in thy awful beauty ; the stars hide themselves in the
ss<y3 the moon, cold and pale, finks in the western wave. But
thou thyself movest alone ; who can be a companion of thy course?
The oaks of the mountains fall3 the mountains themselves decay
with years3 the ocean shrinks and grows again3 the moon her-
self is lost in heaven ε but thou art for ever the same ; rejoicing in
the brightness of thy course. When the world is dark with tem-
pests; when thunder rolls‚ and lightning flies3 thou lookest in
thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to
Offian, thou lookest in vain ; for he behold¹s thy beams no more ;
whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds, or thou tren-.—
brest ut the gates of the west. But thou art perhaps, like me,
for a season 3 thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sscep in thy
clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exult then, O sun,
in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and mim-<2153 it is
like the glimmering light of the nioon, when it {hines through
broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills3 the blast of north is

on the plain, the traveller l'hrinks in the midst of his journey.
