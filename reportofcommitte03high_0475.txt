‘The critical Exposition prefixed to -the Tain, gives a ,
brief account of it in the technical terms of the Scots
literature of the remote age in which it was written.
‘⁶ Ceathardha connagur in each ealathuin is cuincda don
tsairsisi na Tana. Loc di cedamus lighe Fercusa mhic
Roich ait in rou hathnachd four mach Nai. Tempus

That ἰε-Τὴε four things which are requisite to be s
known in every regular composition are to be noticed in this
work of the Tain. The PLAcE of its origin is the stone of
Fergus son of Roich, where he was buried on the plain of
Nai. The ΤΙΜΕ of it, besides, is that in which Diarmad
son of Gervail, reigned over Ireland. The AUTHOR, too, is
Fergus son of Roich; for he it was that prompted it forth-
with to the bards. The CAUSE of writing it was avisit
which Shenachan Torbda with three chief bards made to
Guaire King of Connachr.

The subject and character of this TAIN bho Cuaz'lgne is
concisely and justly expressed by Roderic O Flaherty.
‘⁶ Fergusius Rogius solo pariter ac solio Ultoniae exter-
minatus, in Connactiam ad Ollilum et Maudam ibidem reg-
nantes profugit3 quibus patrocinantibus, memorabile exar-
sit bellum septannale inter Connactios et Ultonios multis
poeticis figmentis, ut ea ferebat aetas, adornatum. Hujus
belli circiter medium, octennio ante caput aerae Christianae,
issanda regina Connactiae‚ Fergusio Rogio ductore, im-
mensam boum praedam conspicuis agentium et insectantium
virtutibus memorabilem, e Cualgnio in agro Louthiano re.
