POEMS OF OSSIA'N. 183

It is needless to enter into any ‚particula-r illustra-
fion, ⁴to {hew how fimple and natural the pfflure of
Fingal is in the origIna13 how much altered from
that fimplicity in Maepherson's transsation. In the
original the pitture prompts the word33 in Mac-
pherson’s transsation, the expreffion is thought of,
without attending to the pieture. Maepherson wishes
, to ¹give an explanation or commentary to his reader 3
·’ 'he will not trust to his understanding or feeling the
'·meaning and force of the fimple expreffion in the
original, ⁶ He¹ saw the winds without force‚’ but
tells, by an interpolation, what that expreflion 'nn-
J ports. ⁶ His darketzed brow hemis sor-teutrd to the
’Δ coast ; he looks back to the [αξξ-ἰῆς wind? He makes
his silence terrible, when there was no one to see or
feel :terror from it. The original, savin, which it is
’ djfficult to find an exa& English word for, means

something light, vain, that has no consequence οῖ
’ meaning.

The harbour of little hills received the ship-
There was a rock on the edge of the sea; 1
The wood madnig over the found of the wax’e,s.’
