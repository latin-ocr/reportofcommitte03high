LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE. 89

not opened for many years, a sheet of an old Gaelic poem,
and mentioned to a brother of mine, who was with me at
the time, that I had not the least recollection how Ι came
by it, upon which he put me in mind that I had told him
*when he had seen it, with some others, (above twenty
years ag0,) they had been got, (together with a collec-
. tion of Proverbs sent to Mr Macintosh,) from Captain
· Alexander Campbell, then chamberlain of Kintyre, who
had them from one william Mac Mumhy, a musician, and
an amateur of ancient poetry. This circumstance I men-
tion, to shew you how little Ι troubled my memory with
any particulars relative to these pocms. One circumstance,
however, Ι remember well, that a man who had given me
the use of a pareel of poems, without any restriction‚ had
long threatened a prosecution,‡0r publishino what he called
translations of his collection of poems, and alledged he had
a claim to a share of the profits. I believe however, upon
enquiry, that he understood the profits were only a serious
loss, as I had been persuaded to run shares with a book-
sellcr in the publication, which to me turned out so bad a
concern (when my income was but thirty pounds a year,)
that Ι could never since think of Gaelic poetry with plea-
sure or with patience, except to wish it had been dead be-
fore I was born. The circumstance I have just mention-
ed, may be construed in favour of the authentia-{ty of these
poems; but on the other side, I have to mention that, in
my observing the beauty of mmm
those poems, (Ι forget which) the person who gave it me
as an ancient poem, said, these :rere ef his own composition.
This assertion, l placed then to the amount of his vanity3
but I think it right lo state it 'to-you as I had it, (md leaveyom
to think cs it what yon plegcse. I feel no interest in the que-
stion, in its issue, v01· in the sate of the poetry. Indccd, I
know little of what has been said, pro or con, on the sub-
ject for these many yearss having neither the opportunity
