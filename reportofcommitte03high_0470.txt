286 ACCOUNT OF

and in this venerable sense it was applied to Bishops in the
early ages of the Church, as we learn from St. Angustia¹
and some succeeding writers quoted by Du Gange under
the word Papa. In the Easter11 Church it was, at one pe-
riod, given to Abbots‚ and even to Priests or Presbyters.
When the Bishops of Rome acquired the direction
of the Western Church‚ they affected an exclusive right to
the title of Pope, which they continued to assume frorri the
time of Leo the F irst, or Great (A. D. ‘Mo—4610, while
others received it only as matter of courtesy. So in the
Eastern Church, too, it came in process of time to be mo-
nopolized by the Patriarchs of Alexandria3 which made
some Roman Pontiffs take the title of Universa] Pope⁷ as
John VIII. is styled in the council held at Pavia in the
year 876⁸&

To apply this information to our purpose: The Scots

and Picts, as we are expressly informed by Bede‚ derived , -

their Christian profession from St. John the Evangelist‚ ac-
cording to the usage of the Churches of Asia, and the wri-
tings of Anatolius‚ who was Bishop of Laodicea in Syria
· about the year 280, and wrote, among other works‚ a learn-
ed book on the observance of the Pasch‚ a fragment of
which is preserved by Eusebius†. Their clergy, accord-
ingly, long opposed the peculiar rites and tenets of the Ro-
mish Church with so much zeal‚ that they would not even
eat in company with churchmen of that persuasion‚ whom
they, as well as the ancient British and Irish, whose
Christianity was derived from the same source, regarded as
little better than Pagans Ι.
