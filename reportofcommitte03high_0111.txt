poems. My defign is to examine the evidence in a
postscript to the next edition of my dissertation and
history; but if the publication of the evidence, for
which Ι have waited these two yearS, be delayed any
longer, Ι conceive myself entitled to annex Mr
Hume's letters to a new edition of my differtation
next winter. -

From the following passages in Mr Hume’s letters,
your Lordlhip must be sensible that an unreservcd
publication of the whole correspondence, not only
with Dr mair, but with the Highland Society, be-
comes absolutely indispensable. ‘⁶ Ithink it were
suitable to your candour, and most satisfactory also
to the reader‚ to publish all the answers to all the
letters you write, even though some of these answers
should make somewhat against your own opinion in
this affair. We {hall always be the more affured
that no arguments are strained beyond their proper
force, and no contrary arguments suppreffed, where
such an entire communication is made to us· '’ “ I
cannot conceive any objection which a man even of
the gravest character could have to your publication
of his letters, which will only attest a plain fa&
known to him.” After these paffages, a partial or
mutilated account of ' the correspondence would dis-
credit the whole, and the objection to Dr Blair’s
Appendix would subfist in full force, that instead of
publilhing the evidence as he received it, he gave a
partial abstract, tinged unavoidably with his own
prejudices and preconceived belief. No man is en-

titled to give his evidence, who objects to the letter
