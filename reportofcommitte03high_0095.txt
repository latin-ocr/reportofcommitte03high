ΤΗΕ BED O'F GAUL.

‘ Ο spread the bed of Gaul, ye sons of the strings,
and his sun-beam close by him, where his bed may
be marked from afar, 'though overlhadowed with
lofty bough83 under the oak of the greenest blow,
that quickest grows, and of the most lasting hue,
that pours out her leaves on the breath of the
ihower, though the field all around be withered.
Her leaves, from the utmost bounds, shall be seen
by the birds of l'ummer, and every bird, as he
comes, alights on the top of the bough of Strumon.
Gaul lhall hear their chaunting in his mist, and vir-
gins finging of Evirchoma. Till the succeeding
changes take place, the memory of you shall not be
torn asunder. Till the stone moulder into dust‚—
till with age this branch shall wither‚—-till the brooks
cease to run‚-—till the source of the mountain stream
run dry,—-till in the flood of time be lost the age of
every bard, ong, and subje& οι every tale5-the
stranger {hall not ass<‚ ⁶ Who is the son of Morni?'
or, ‘ VVhere dwells the king of Str-umen ,θ’
