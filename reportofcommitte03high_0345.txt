MR. M‘PHERSON’S ron-mr. 161

'she' brpken skull and shiver’d helmet ‘strow’d,

The sandy plain that reeks with human blood3

He gasping falls, and shakes the thund’ring ground,
And dying, toss'd his quiv'ring limbs around.--
Thus falls an oak that long majestic stood¹

The tallest honours of the waving wood.
Deep-hack’d by the ship-wright's unerring hand,
Groans, slew-inclines, and falling, shakes the land.
