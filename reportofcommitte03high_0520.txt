In yonder meadow to the south-west.”
We then made the impetuous onset‚
Such as I have not seen nor heard ‘'f?
As a cloud gives out its fire,
Each hero dealt destruction.
As the decayed grove of the mountain
Sinks under the rapid sweep of the whirlwind9
So were the mighty overturned ¹
As they fen under our feet in hattle.
Manos‚ leader of the host, has fallen,
Like a fiery meteor in the firth of currents.
Grievous was the cry of his heroes,
When their spreading voice was heard around, ’
Except a man who sought his peace ¹⁹
Or who took protection under our shield, ’
None of the followers of Lochl'in’s king
Returned to his own land.
I declare by my king,
who was never defeated in battle,

That there fell in our seven bande
A third of the chiefs of Inisfail.
