’Τ-ΗΕ Mistakes which have been noticed are but a few of
’ what the Poem of URNIGH OssmN contains. Nor are the
‚other poems in the collection more exempt from error.

Δ Two instances to be taken from the first of these which is

renti‘ssed Os'sian agas an Clerich will suffice.

-x Sianzastss. ‘⁶ Se huirt‘ an Tosgar ‘bu mhor Brigh
”⁶ ‘⁸' ⁴ ‘⁶ Diong‘amsa·Ri0gh Inse-Tore

‘⁴ S Cinn a Dha chomhirlich dheig

, Translated, “- Then says Oscar of mighty strength, ⁶ Cive
¹ “ me the King of Inistore [the Island qf Wild Bous-s ‚·] his
·“ twelve nobles have a sweet voice, leave me to qucll
‘⁴ them.”

The actual signification of Inse-Tore‚ or rather Inse toir,
is qf the eastern Isle ,- but the translator seems to have read
it, as it was probably reehed, luent-tore, which means, ‹gfthc x
‘island quoczrs.

Cinn a dha chomhirlich dheig, signifies the headr qs his
twelve counsellors. The erroneous translation appears to

have proceeded from the translator’s taking Cinn, hecub, for
¹binn, sweet >qs voice, or musical, and not understanding the
meaning of ›chomhirlich, counsellors.

Stanza 31. l. 3. ⁶¹ Meirg Riegh Loehlan an aigh'' is trans-
’ lated ‘¹‘ the iron King of Lochlin‚” instead of the standard (gf

Lochlin's [euspicious King„

It is not without regret that I have observed the Enquiry
of a writer possessed of learning, ingenuit-v, and candour,
thus teeming with errors3 which proceeded in part from
his being an entire stranger to the language in which the
poems he sought after were composed‚.and were, in part,
owing to the ignorance of his scribes and translators,
