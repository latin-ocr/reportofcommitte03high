In the number of these may be ranked the tale of the
new-found giant Uvavat, mentioned above, whose bruising V
match with Gaul proves him «still ⁴⁶ mightier and greater-’⁹ ⁵
than this last3 who, Mr. Hill in‘forms us, ‘⁶ he had obser- ’
4⁶ ved in p. 19. to be general& esteemed one of the greatest of
“- the giants :'’ forgetting‚ no doubt, that all he had obser-
ved in p. 19. was, that “ Gaul is always called Mboir
⁴⁶ Ghuill or Great Gau-22 and seems to h-ave been esteemed ⁷
⁴¹⁶ one of the largest of the Fingal-ian giants.” To which
he adds, ·⁶‘ See Ossian agus an Clerich, v. 10. F hir mhoir:
“.‘ great man or giant, &eff 'But certain it is, that Gaul λ

violation of idiom, and that <Gon mor (as he has it in p. ΓΙ,
line ll.) is the Gaelic of ›Great Gaul; which epithet, how- ¹
ever, is only bestowed upon him occasionally. And tho‘ “
it be true that the words shir mhoir (in the genitive definite, ,
and vocative, cases) signify great man, they denote a giant
no more than they do a dwarf.; as is plainly seen by the
very „v. 10. to which the reference is made„ and is as fol-

‘⁵ They ‘bore away from the woods ; they put on their

‘⁶ they bore away from the shoress'

According to our author's conjecture, every great manin ,
the host of Lochlin (to which this verse refers) must have
been a giant3 and' every man throughout scotland and Ire-
land, who approaches or exceeds the height of six feet, and ’
{s thick in proportion, is also to be regarded as a giant, be-
