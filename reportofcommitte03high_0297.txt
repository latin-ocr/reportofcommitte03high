'010' THE ORIGINAL. 113

When Meyv found herself rejected
In the esteem of the hero οξ untainted character,
She devised to wound his body,
Because he would not partake in her guile.

For him she laid the snare of dearh,
Because he did not comply with a woman’s wishes 5
sad was the destroying of him by a monster,
In the manner which I now shall candidly tell.

On the lake of Meyv was a mountain ash‚
Where southward spreads the shore,
And during each momh of the season
Its fruit was seen to be ripe.

Such was the virtue of its clusters
That sweeter it was than the honey of flowers,
And the reddened fruit would support
A person deprived of food for three days.

. A year to the life of man,
It is certain that it woqu add,
And the diseased derived relief

From the juice of its ripened berry.

But danger hung on the pursuit of it,
For, though it proved a cure to the people,
A venomous monster lurked at its root

To prevent all from approaching to pluck it.

Grievous sickness seized
The daughter of Omhach of the genereus cups τ
