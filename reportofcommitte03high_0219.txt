LETTERS 'ro nn, BLAIR. 35

*he neighbouring continent were very numerous. There
are the ’remains of about thirty places of worship in this
and the two neighbouring parishes, besides monasteries.
These reformers were certainly animated with the usual
zeal of extinguishing the old religion, with all its appurte-
, nances. The sacred hymns suffered in this devastation‚
for there is not one couplet of them existing. Y'ou will
perhaps be surprised to hear, that the goddess* of 'Victory,
Andate‚ (the Andraste of Dio‚) who had a temple at Ca·-
“” malodunum, had a particular veneration paid her in this
part of the world. There are no less than the remains of
four places of worship for her in this island: the most
considerable of them lies within an half mile of the· castle
of Dunvegan, (Anaid in Buy) of which Macleod will
give you a description. As human sacrifices were offered
Ι at her shrine, the christian missionaries must have been
Ᾰ greatly shocked at the priests who officiated at these
bloody rituals·; in so far that, to this day, when we talk
of a cruel gavage, we call him a Druid. A little refleca
tion will easily account for the loss of the sacred poemS,
as well as ·f0r the little notice taken of religion in the hes-
„ roic ones. Perhaps it would have been construed a
, sacrilegious encroachment on the holy office, to mention
the concerns of religion in profane songs; or, if any
such mention was made, the rehearsers in after times
would have been taught to drop it, as an abomination to
christian ears. I should ask your pardon for obtruda
ing all this trash upon you, but believe mc to be, very'
respectfully,
Reverend and dear Sir,
Your very affectionate' ’
humble servant,
Don. MACQUEEN.
