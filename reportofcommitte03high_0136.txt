of that learned clergyman, his collation of many '
of Kennedy's‚ with copies of the same poems which
he had procured‚ and the insertion of many he had
received from other hands, besides those of Mr Ken-

Anedy‚ it was rendered a much more interesting vo-

lume than Kennedy's, had he publissied it, could .

pofl‘effion, of this Society, confists of the following
poems, viZ. Luachair Leothaid‚ S giathan mac Sgairbh,
An Gruagach, Roehd, Sithallan‚ Mur Bheura‚ Ti-

Dheirg, Bas Chuinn‚ Righ Liur, Sealg na Leana,
Dun an Oir, An Cu dubh, Gleann Diamhair, Conal‚
Bas Chiuinlaich Diarmad, Carril‚ Eas Ghuill, (quite

of ribaldry put into the mouth of Connar's wife.
Part of the original poem, which contains a curious
description of the manners of the Fingalian heroes,
with a transsation, in which fimplicity is more at-
tended to than grace, is inserted in the AppendiX,
No, 20. To each of those poems Kennedy has pre-
