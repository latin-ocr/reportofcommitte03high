LETTERS To DR. BLAIR. 5

in this country to-be present when this trial i: made 3 but
I believe I can entrust it to people who will execure it very
faithfully. I am sorry I have so little leisure to write ιο
you at present : this will serve only to tell you how little I
can do. I wish hearrily it were in my power to do more.
...If any thing occurs to me to be done, before Ι leave the
country, I will acquaint you ; at any rate, Ξ ’σν-ΞΠ trouble
you with another letter when I have conversed with people
who can give some assistance {21 the izivestigassion.

I perceived this scepticism beginning long ago, and fore-
saw the difficulty of answering it. Mr Huzne certainly
sees the con e'iuence of it to the reputation of the poem
in a very right light ; and it must give great pleasure to any
one connected with this country, to obviate this evil5 but
I have great doubt of such evidences being procured, as
the case requires. Though I can do little, nothing shall be
wanting, to fight Ossian’s cause, thar lies in the power of,

Dear Sir,
Your most obedient,
and most humble servant.-

dated Sleat‚ 14th October 1763.

DEAR SIR,

YOUR letter of September 28th carne to
hand four days ago. Before I speak to the contents, you
will permit me to say, however little that declaration may
ἶ signify, that not any one in this part of the world can have
more sensible pleasure in doing a thing that can afford Dr
Blair any degree of satisfaction. The testimonics I had of
,his benevolence, when last in Edinburgh‚ give him an un-
doubted right to all the small services in my power.
