ΡσεΜε or os‘sxAN. 39

Sm, Kincardine, 4th March 1801.

As 1 have not seen Mr Laing’s history, 1 can
form no opinion as to the arguments wherewith he
has attempted to discredit Offian's poems ε the at-
tempt could not come more naturally than from
Orcadians*. Perhaps the severe checks given by the
ancient Caledonians to their predatory Scandinavian
predeceffors raised prejudices not yet extinct. I con-
ceive how an author can write under the influence
of prejudice, and not senfible of being aeted upon
by it.

I stand persuaded, that Mr Laing’s arguments
cannot stagger my belief in the authenticity of Os-
sian’s poems. Before Mr Maepherson could know
his right hand from his left, 1 have heard fragments
of them repeated, and many of those fragments 1
recognized in Mr Maepherson’s transsation.

Fingal’s standard was my very early acquaIntance:
‘ Togair Deo Grein e re Crann, Brattach Fhinn 'sbu
mhor a meas) The concluding conflift betwixt Fin-
gal and the king of Lochlin engaged my young fan·
cy so much, that the following stanza is still remem-
bered by me.

δ Tilgidar dhubh 'n airrn dhaithte,
Fine-hadar spairn 'nda laoich.
Clachan agus talarnh trom
Do glxluaisd iad le bonn ’n 005.Ι
