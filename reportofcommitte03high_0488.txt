The test which such an agreement affords‚ at a distance
>of almost 300 years, of the fidelity of traditionY cannot but
seem curions to-such as have not had an opportunity of ob-
serving the strength which memory can attain‚ when unas-
sistedr by wrifing, and prompted to exertion by the love of
poetry and song. With this view the following instances
are given :

1. Α poem by Conal son of Edirskeol (p. 205 of our MS,)
'nearly agrees with one in Kennedy's Collection, p. 69. Some
of the names are different, and the sentences are not au in the
same order. The four last stanzas but one of Kennedy’s co-
py, are entirely wanting in this. They are superior to the
general tenor of the poem, which exhibits a singular mixture
of barbarous revenge ancl generous sentiment,

The same poem appears with a few lines more or less,
and a slight variation of words and arrangement in the last
of the Kilbride MSS. (Fol. 83.) above noticed, and in two
several ‘editions communicated to the Society., the one by
Robert Campbell Esq. advocate, from the recital of an old
man in Ila, and the' other by Mr. Malcolm M‘Donald,
Tarbett‚ from the recitation of Donald Mac Callum in
Kilcalmonell of Kintire.

2. A poem by Ossian (p. 220.) on the failure and fall
of Dayro borb, son of the King of Sora, differs very little
stom Kennedy’s and other oral editions in the possession of
the Society‚ in which the hero’s designation, however, is
Mayro borb.

The four concluding verses which are given by our ΜΒ,
as a separate reading‚- are omitted in some of the oral edi-
tions, aud retained in others. Kennedy's edition has twelve
lines (being the Sd and 4th stanzas of his 24th page, and
the sd stanza of his esth) which are not in the Dean’s‚ and
seem to have originally belonged to a different poem.

v ⁴3. A poem hy Ossian (p. 63.) descriptive of a chace,
the most successful that Fingal was ever engaged in, corre!
