of our ancestors : for the descendants of these heroes main-
eained their independence on the main land, and retained
‘the historical traditions and poetry of their fathers over
every part of our country.

. However conspicuous may be the character, and how-
ever profound the learning of those men who assert, that
the poems of Ossian are a forgery of modern times, but
who „confess themselves ignorant of the language in which
these poems are handed down, I should reckon their igno-
rance of the matter in· question a strong argument against

'¹' our paying any deferenee to their opinions; seeing that

there is not one Highiander, not one individual acquainted
with our country and the Gael'ic language, who has ever, for

-a moment, doubted the authenticity of these poems, There

is none of us who has not heard frequent mention of the
‚characters that occur in them. The farther back we trace
the traditions‚ and the more accurately we enquire into
the characters to which they allude, our conviction be-

comes the stronger that they can neither be fictitious nor

’ imaginary.

Itis no argument against the transmission of these an·-

Α cient poems, that no man can now be found who is able to

Ἴ tepeat the whole of them. There are few men who can

⁸ repeat much of any poetry with accuracy3 excepting such

⁵ persons as make it their profession, and who earn their
· bread by their memories. It is enough that thousands can

he still found in our Highlands and Isles who can recite
many detached portione of them, according as they were
pleased with particular passages, or as certain incidems re-
corded in them made a peculiar impression on their minds.
How, if all were fictitium, could so many poems, named
after Ossian, have existed for so many hundred years, and
,been still retained amongst the remostest islands‚ and the
most sequeste‘red corner-3 of our Highlands.
