*⁴ Two several readings now occur for ten lines of the MS. which, as,
they are inconfistent with one another, so are they also with the tenor of
the poem. For whereas fifty were repeatedly stated to be the exa& num-
ber of warriors who accompaniedFingal on this occafion, yet in the first
of these readings, twenty-seven only are said to have engaged Dayro, who
bound them; though it is added immediately after, that all the warriors then
present were wouuded, and Flan son of Mox-ni ssain by him. And in the
second of the readings, fifty warrior-s are represented as saving their com-
panions from the sword of Dayro, by a seasonable exertion of valour.
