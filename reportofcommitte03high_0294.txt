1⁵10 A'm'xm Am) Tm:
Burst, bursb my heart Ξ the lovely youth is dead,
μ Who, like the dawn5 was wo'nt to bring me joy 3
Now birds of prey will hover round his head,
And wild beasts seek his carcase to destroy;
While I who lov’d him, and was lov'd again,
With sighs and Iamentable strains must ten,
How b'y no hero⁴s xialour he* was slain‚‘
But struggling with a beast inglorious fell !
This makes my tear‘s‘ with double anguish floW3'
This adds affiiction to my bitter woe Ξ

- Yet fame and dauntless valour he could boast3
With matchless strength his manly limbs were'
Ἰ bound ς
What force would have dismay’d amighty host,-
He show’d, before the dragon could him wound.·
His curling looks, that wanton’d in the breeze3·
Were blacker than the raven's ebon wing;
His teeth were whiter than the fragrant trees,-
When blossoms clothe them 1n the days of spring3
A brighter red his glowing cheeks did stain,
Thau blood of tendet heifer newly slaim-

A purer azure Sparkled m his eye,
Thau that of icy shoal in mountain found ς’
Whene’er he· spoke5 hi's voice was melody,
And sweeter far than instrumental sound.
O he was lovely ! fair as purest suow,
ι Whose wreaths' the tops of highest mountai'ns
crown3
His lips were radiant as the heav'nly bow;
His skin was softer than the sostest down,
More sweet his breath5 than fragrant bloom, or rose,
Or gale that cross a ssow’ry garden blows.
