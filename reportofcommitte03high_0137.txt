oount of the Sgealachd, story, or argument, of the
poem which is to follow. Those sgealachdS, it was?
very common for the reciter, or history man, (as
they were sometimes termed in the Highlands), to·
give to his hearers, before he began to repeat the
poems to which they related. From them Dr Smith
has candidly confeffed that he has been sometimes
obliged to fill up gaps which the want of memory in
the reciter had occafioned in the poems 3 but he has
very properly distinguished them, when they occur,
which is not often, from the poem itself. If ΜΓ
Maepherson availed himself of such affistance, he

It is worthy of notice, that several of the poems
contained in this collection of Kennedy's, correspond
pretty nearly with the ancient MS. above mentioned,
which belonged to the dean of Lismore, as well as
with others communicated to the Committee. For
a comparison of those in detail, vide Appendix, No,
