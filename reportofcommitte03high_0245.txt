sion, to listen to advice: and when unjust censures were
ξ thrown out against him, obstinate in his purpose of disre-
” garding and contemning them, without the least concern of
7 giving any satisfaction to those who opposed or cavilled at
him. ’
’δεεΡτὶοἰςω has indeed been entertained by many, how
ζ far his work, supposing it to be no imposture on the whole,
could be relied upon as an accurate and faithful translation
,ἶ of his Gaelic originals. That in some of the longer works,
,, he may have combined and brought together some pieces
which he found scattered and broken, and that, in compar-
* ing the different copies which he frequently found of the
same poem, cither in manuscript or by rehearsal, he se-
¹>- lected from them all such as he thought the best readings,
Ῑ make no doubt, nor did he himself seem to disavow it.
· Ι also think it probable that he may have left out some
- rudenesses and extravagancies which he might occasionally
find in the old Gaelic songs. But after all the cnquiries I
’ have been at pains to make, I can find no ground to su-
* spect that his deviations from the original text were at all
a· considerable, or his interpolations ary more than what
7‹¹.-· were simply necessary to connect together picces of one
’ᾗ whole which he foun'd disjointed: That his work, as it
ᾗῇ stands, exhibits a genuine authentic view of ancient Gaelic
’ᾖ poetry, 1 am as firle persuaded, as I can be of any thing.
f It will, however, be a great satisfactiou to the learned
world, if that publication shall be completed‚ which ΜΓ
f* Maepherson had begun, of the whole Gaelic originals in
, their native state on one page, and a literal Latin translation
, on the opposite page. The idea which he o'nce entertain-
’ἵ ed, and of which he showed me a specimen, of printing
the Gaelic in Greek characters, (to avoid the disputes
,Λ about Gaelic orthography), I indeed strongly reprobated,
= as what would carry to the world a strange affected appear*
