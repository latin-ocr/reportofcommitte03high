GAELIC MANUSCRIPTS. 309

It is, however, worthy of remark, that a chapter of this
ancient work, which is entitled ‘⁶ Slogha Chesair an Inis
Bhreatan‚’' or Caesar’s Expedition to Britain, contains the
following notice concerning Lochlin, a country so often men..
tioned in our ancient poems and tales.

rnark, and Norway *Γ

Whence it is evident, that the Rhine formed the western
boundary of the ancient Lochlin3 and as the term is still
understood (both in the Welsh and Gaelic) of Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden, ancl all those northern regions rnen-
