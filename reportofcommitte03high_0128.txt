REPORT ΟΝ ΤΗΒ

In termq of her soft greet'in'g.
The king of aspe& mild enquired aloud‚
From what quarter the fair complexioned maid. had come,

Or what land she had left for that of Fingal. Ρ
——‘ ‘Give us briefly your report”

“Daughter Ι am to the king of the wave- surrounded land ς

Its groves proclaim my tearful moans.

But of all the lands which the sun surrounds 1n his course,

Thine of the generous brave ιε that which Ι foughtss’
“Princess of the easy gait. ¹
Young maid of the perse& form !

The purpose on which you came from afar, ’

, Declare‚ though to me it be bitter.''

‘⁸ Thy support Ι claim, if thou art Fingal ;’'
(Said the maid addreffing us‚)·

“ For the excessenbe of th'y kingly mien and fame,
Vouchsafe me speedily and seasonably thy protetffionss’
‘⁵ Wh0,” (said the king who knew afar),

“ Is the person that now pursues you ?

le proteRiom O maid ἔ 1hallbe yOur defence
Agajnst all who dare.’'

“ There comes with wrath over sea,

A warrior renowned for might in pursuit of me ς,
The son of the king of Sora's land, of keen arms,
Whose name is Dayro Borb.

To his suit I opposed a vow,

That Fingal should receive me from off the sea,
And that I should never be his spouse,

Though great were his deeds, and high his fame.'’
Briefly replied, with determined voice,

He who could check each kin gi

“ Until the men of Fin'gal break thy vow,·

His sponse thou {hart not be.'’

We see advancing on the wave

A warrior whose stature none could equal,
Travelling the sea with speed,

15³ the very direfiion the maid had come„
