120 * REPORT oN THE

The heroes gave a hundred turns of strength,
By the border of thesea, on the smooth white bench.
The blast of their nostrils was heard across the hsslocks,
And the noise of their feet in the struggle.
Conal was thrown down by the mighty,
'Who bound him, without a wound like the rest.
Arduous was the deed he atchieved ’
On the {hore of the dark-coloured ocean.’

Conal sends for Cuchnllin to oppose thevifizorious
stranger‚·whose progress to the combat is described
with the same sublime and terrible imagery which

is given in Macpherson's transsation of the Deall) qs
Cuchullin. a

³⁸ The same passage is found almost verbatim in Sinitlfs JMaa
κω. ‘ This paffage‚' says Dr Smith, in a note on that poem,
(Scan Dana, p. 262.) ‘ is much admired in the original, and is

Ι therefore inserted for the sake of such as may understand i⁴t.’

Such striking passages, which, from the impreffion they make,
are in the mouth of every reciter, are often thus transferred from
one poem to another, when they are applicable to the story or
fituation. The fituation of Fingal in the poem of Manos is cer-
tainly better suited to this poetical description of the terrors of
his march, than that of Cuchullin in this poem of Conloch.‘
The subje& of this paffage is remarkable, as the Spirit (ff Loda
has been a cause of dispute among the inquirers into the authen·
ficit? of the poems of Offiam ⁷ ’
