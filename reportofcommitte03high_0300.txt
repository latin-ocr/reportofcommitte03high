Would it had been in the strife of heroe55
That Fraoch the bestower of gold had fallen.
Sad is his having fallen by a monster,
Woeful it is to survive him ἔ-

Blacker than the raven was the growth of his hair,
Redder was his cheek than the blood of the fawn;
Smoother than the foam of stream&

Whiter tha-n snow was the skin of F raochffi

Strong-er than a* gat-e was his· shield,
Many a hero< gathered around it ; Χ
Long as his sword was his arm,
Broad as the plank of a ship was his blade.

Taller than a mast was his spear,
Sweeter than the string of music was his voice„
A swimmer who excelled Fraoeh
Never laid his side to a stream..

Good was the> strength of his arms,
And exceeding good was the swiftness of his feet.

In sou] he was superior to a king,
Of champion he never declined the combat.

Lovefy was the chief who‘m the people esteemed,
Lovely the cheek which vied with the rose in redness,v
Lovely the mouth which opposed not friendship's call,
And which the fair declined- not to kiss‚

We bore ‘to the grove of Fraoch,
The body of the hero to its circular pale ι
After the worthy has died,
To be alive is our regret'.
