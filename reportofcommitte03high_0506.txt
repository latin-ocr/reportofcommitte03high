318 ExTRAc‘r oF A PoEM, Ετσ.

The heroes have gone to the grave

That sees not day,

Which has caused mine eye to be in mist.

Ι am likz the 10ne1y wounded bird of the mod,
While I mourn without ceasing in the hall,
Without sight, or offipring, οι· cause of joy.
I am like the tree whose growth has ceased,
Or like the nut in its withered husk,

Ready to drop down to the ground.
Grievous it is to the sorrowful heart,

That it cannot derive relies from friends.
Like the dying hart is my form,

My voice siuks under the dew of night !
