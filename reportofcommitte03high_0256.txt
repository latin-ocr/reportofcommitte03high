72 LETTERS To MR. MAcKEsz.

The refinement of mamiers in Ossian²s poems is, as you
observe, a well known objection against this authenticity.
But let our history be investigated, and I am satisfied this
objection will be done away. What if we shall produce
passages purely historical, and undeniably more than 1000
years old, that are no less refined and delicate? Take the
first instance that occurs to my memory, and I think it
would not disgrace even the man qffielz'rzg in the 18th
century :--“ See that crane coming towards our shore, in
its ssight over from Ireland. It is quite spent, and obliged
to alight in the water. Run, take up the poor bird, bring
it to the house, feed it, and take care of it for three days,
till it be sufficiently refreshed, and able to return to its na-‚
tive land, and for thy kindness and hospitali:y‚ my son,
God will bless thee.'’ I quote from memory, and do not
pretend to have the exact rendering of the words, but I arn
sure I have the exact rendering of the sentiment, Investi-
gate our history, and it will give credibility toour poetry,
in more respects than in delicacy of sentiment. *We have
but lately emerged from a long night of barbarism3 but

previous to that night, there existed, as there is much rea-‘

son to believe, a period of considerable light and refine-
ment. I have made some efforts, not as yet very success7
fully, to penetrate the darkness, in which Highland history
is involved. I hope more will be done by those who have
more opportunity3 and that the Highland Society wil'l at÷
tend to the ancient history, as well as to the ancient poetry,
of the Highlandssf I am, with respect and esteem, Ἰ
