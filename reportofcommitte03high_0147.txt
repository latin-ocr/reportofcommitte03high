θ Mighty man who hast come to us over sea !

The warmth of affed'tion has kindled for thee in my heart.
Thy hair is like the golden bearn of the sun,

Which sparkles on yonder mountain.

Thy form is like the hanging branch of the vale,

Which the warrnth of summer has covered with beauty.
Soft is thy bmw, mildly move thine eyehds,

As the gentle breeze on the edge of the hill.

Like the bloffom of trees are thy cheeks ;

Long and full, Ο champion ! is thy chest.

Thine eye is like dew on the plain of the mountain ς
Redder are thy lips than the strawbeny.

Thy teeth are like snow which has newly fallen upon branthes.
Thou seemest like the sun when he opens on the lhadowy plain.
Fair and gentle youth of the auburn ringlets!

Great hast thou become, and goodly is thy prowess.

Do thou now attend to the purport of my address,

O hero, who excellest in deeds and conduet Ξ

What has moved thee from the place of thy refidence ?

If it was to give me tbine aid, great is my joy.

I have come in quality of meffenger

To inquire of thee who thy people are ς
who thou art thyself, or who thy friends;

“ And in what place thou hast been trained ?”

“ That is what I cannot reveni,
But to one who {hall wrest it from mc ’τος force.
If I could declare it to any one uper. cm'nv
From a person of thy bearing I would not withhoh} it.¹'
“ Here stands the king of Ullin and Tonnagorma,
who is the fiercest among the heroes of Erin.
Conceal not thy story from me, O warrior,
Though great be thy might in the strifc of death !'’
“ My story cannot be rex-exiled,
O Conal of the thousand battles !
For I am under engagement not to declare myself‚
Until superior strength do force me.'’
