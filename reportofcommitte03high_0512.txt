Against' your· O Cuchuillin. ’
When I behold the arms of the hero,

The shield and the sword of Conlach,
I am such in lamenting,

Alas'3 that it was'not in Munster of plainsss,

Or in Cruachan of the fierce warriorsl,

That my belov'ed Conloch fell.

In Spain or in Hesperia,
Or in the land of Saxons, of free peoples
