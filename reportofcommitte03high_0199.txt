Ossian was the Homer of the ancient Highlanders, and
at the same time one of their most illustrious heroes. A
people who held bards in the highest esteem, and paid
withal the profoundest respect to the memory of those who
had distinguished themselves among their ancestors by mi..

place : nor is that old custom‚ after all the changes that taste
has suffered here, entirely discontinued at this time. When
these two customs prevailed univer-sally‚ or nearly so,
when thousands piqued themselves upon their acquaintance
with the works of Ossian ; when men extremely poor, su-
perannuated, or any how rendered ineapable of earning
their bread in another way, were sure of finding kind pa-
