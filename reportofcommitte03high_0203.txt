clergyman and mys‘elf, that he had himself transcribed
above one hundred pages of a large ancient manuscript
which treated of th'e wars of Fingal and Comhal his fa-

read, a considerable part of the said ancient manuscript:
and rehearsed from mernory, before me, some passages of it
that agreed exactly with the translation, viz. the terms of
peace proposed by Morla in Swaran's name to Cuchullin ς

passage alluded to, is Fingal, book v. page 62².
