As he came to land, over the billows„
He rushed on in his fury ;
He neither hailed Fingal nor his peopIe3
The unerring arrow ssew from his hand,
And the maiden fell.
The strife of mighty feats
Bore down the King of Sora's son. O tale of woe Ξ
-On the green mount was (lug his tomb of stone,
And over against it is the stone of the maid.

The son of Gomhal spoke ‘to Gaul,
’“ O Gaul, son o‘f RIorni of mighty deeds,
Do thou turn the battle of the man of might.
Ι King of Fail shall not withhold my aid
If, on this day, thou should’st need it.
Raise‚ O my bards, the strains of triumph,
And spread the melody of song over my dwelling.''

Many a CRmr* and many a harp was tuned,
And many a bard sung the tale.

death! He sunk beneath my sword. We laid them in
two tombs of stone3 the hapless lovers of youth! Ibid.
