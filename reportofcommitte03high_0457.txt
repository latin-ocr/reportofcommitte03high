Sworn before me the nineteenth day of January‘eighteen
hundred and one, and I farther attest, that the said Archi-
bald Fletcher, who, although he can write his name, was not
able to read the manuscript, recited orally in my pre-
sence the whole of the poem called Clann Uisneachan, or
Darthula, and part of the first poem called Rann no Duan
na Inghinn, which, as 1 understand Gaelic, I compared
with the manuscript, and found to agree; and he declared‚
that he was able and willing to recite orally the whole
of the poems particularly specified in his declaration3 and
I farther attest, that the above-mentioned manuscript col-
lection of poems is marked by the declarant and me, of this
date.
