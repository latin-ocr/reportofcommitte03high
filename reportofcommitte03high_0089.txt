As I am, without a person to share my fondness.
Spare them, fince there is not a hero‘to view '
The blue flame of the beautiful torches.
Caothan of the joyful lights,
Thy torches are now darkened ;
Like an oak which has quickly faded,
Thy dwellings and their people have failed.
East or west, on the face of thy mountain,
There is not found of one of them but the tuin. '
In Scallama ³⁸², in Tauro, or fifh-morast,
There is no rhen, nor song, nor harp;
They are all become green mounds,
And their stones in their own meadows.
The stranger will not perceive from the desart
Any one of them fhewing its head throughcthe cloud. ⁶
And thou Seallama‚ house of my delight!
Is this heap thine old ruin ?
Where now grows the fflistle, the heath‚ and the rank grass,
R1our2ing under the drop of night.—
Around my grey locks
The solitary owl flutters‚
And the roe starts from her bed,
without fearing the mournful Offian.
Roe of the hollow Cairns †,
Where dwelt Oscar and Fion ss,
Ι will not do thee any hurt ;
Never {halt thou be wounded by my darn—-
To the top of Seallama I stretch my hand;
The dwelling has no cover but sszy.
I search for the broad {hield below ς
The top of my spear has struck its bosa...-
