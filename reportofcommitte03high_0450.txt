Europe to the eastward, was stamped with the epithet of

Celtic, as was also its {westerly point, Cape Finisterre (ld. .

L. IV. c. 20.)-

After the great body of Celts had moved from Germany,
-in their western progress, across the Rhine, a considerable
number continued to dwell in that country. For we learn
from Tacitus (de morib. Germ. c. 43, 45.) that the Gal-

lic and British languages, which still distinguish the ge- .

nuine posterity of the ancient Gelts, were spoken so late as
the beginning of the second century by the Gothini and Ἰ
AEstyii3 and that the Cimbri (I-b. c. 37.), ²one of the two
denominations into which the Celtic family branched out
at the earliest period of its history, still continued, though
greatly reduced in number, to occupy that portion of Ger-
many from which their renowned ancestors had issued
forth in conjunction with the Teutones, 210 years before,
to crush four consular armies, and force the Roman re-
public to the brink of ruin.

So near a neighbourhood, and so long and familiar an in-
tercourse as subsisted between the Celts of Germany and the
Teutones, could not fail to affect the language of both.
How far that of the former was affected in this way it is
impossible to determine, Moremarusa, preserved by Pliny
(Lib. IV. c. 14.)‚ being the only recorded sample of it.
But the extent to which the speech of the latter was enrich÷
ed in this respect, may be judged of in some measure by
the Scots 01· Irish‚ and Welch words, which are found in
the various dialects of the Teutonic. Some of these are
also common to the Oriental languages and the Greek and
Latin ; so that they may be fairly presumed to have form-
ed a part of the primitive language of Asia, the cradle of
our sace, and to have been brought from thence by the first
