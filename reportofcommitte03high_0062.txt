Maepherson's visit, more volumes were recovered,
and that he would send them to me, did he know
by what charmel. I heard nothing further about
them, nor indeed did I inquire. ’

of the year following. In 1758 116 entered on
his transsation called Gaelic Fragments, and to this
'work he owed his being called to London, and to
