pomus 01³ ossum. ‘59

The first line, for example, of Offian's expedition
to the Lake of Lego, in suit of Evirallin (p. 11.)‚
⁶ Is cuth duine far nach Fionduin,’ is quite inexpli-
emble, th‘e word Fionduin being unknown in the
. Gaelic language, and the word cuth an obsolete ex-
-preffion for head, admitting in this situation of no
meaning. So is likewise ‘Saoith Locha Leige’ (stanza
3.), ‘ Do chloth dhuinn’ (stanza 8.), and ‘ Seachd

- significant. The rest of the more ancient poems are
also more or less corrupted, except Fingal's advice
to Oscar (p. 34.), which is perfeffly ςοῑτεᾶ, and
'the same as it appears in the copy furnished the So-

a comparison of ΜΓ Macpherson's transsations with
parallel paffages, in the poems collected by the Com-
mittee‚ Appendix, ΝΟ. 15.

tiquities, to which were subjoined, a Colleffion of
Ancient Poems, transsated from the Gaelic of Os-
fian, Ullin, Orrmi, and ‹uhta-53 aud the Donr af-
terwards, in 1787, published the originals of the
poenis he hadffo transsated. Some account of the
manner in which he procured these originals‚ him-
