LETTER FROM LoRD BANNAH'NE, ETc. 231

,the largest and most valuable collection of Gaelic manu-
scripts now remaining in the Highlands of Scotland.

The public are no strangers to the desire with which the·
late Lord Hailes was always actuated for informing himself
of whatever respected the history and antiquities of this
country. The course of my duty, while I was Sheriff of
Bate, frequently led me to meet with his Lordship when
holding the Circuit Com-t at Inveraray. On one of these
occasions, our conversation turning on the different opinions
,entertained as to the authenticity of the Poems published
by Mr. M‘Pherson, his Lordship expressed a particular de-
sire to know how far any Gaelic manuscripts of tolerable
antiquity were preserved in the Highlands of Scossand, and
particularly, whether any of them contained remains·0f an-

M‘Pherson had published. ,

Ι told his Lordship‚ that though the gentlemen from
the remoter parts of the Highlands of whom I had made
such inquiries, talked generally of the existence of manu-
scripts, and of their belief that some of them, and par-
ticularly one or two belonging to the family of Clamanald
or the descendants of their bard, had got into the hands of
Mr. M‘Pherson, yet th'at I had not been fortunate enough
to meet with any pers s·o ns who had themselves seen or ex-
amined such manuscripts, or were able to give me an ac-
count of their nature, their supposed antiquity‚ or contents‚
excepting Dr. Hugh M‘Leod, professor of church history
at Glasgow‚ who had assured me he had seen and examin-
ῥὰ several Gaelic manuscripts, partly written upon vellum,
and apparently of great antiquity‚ in the possession of Mr-
M‘Phers0n‚ containing portions of poetry mixed with other
compositions. At the same time I informed his Lordship‚ that
I had met with many persons, and some particularly among
the clergy, whose taste and judgment I could rely upon,
⁴ who assured me of their having heard repeated by country
