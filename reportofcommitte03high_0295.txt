DAUGHTER OF MEYs iit

But whenin battle with our foe's he join'd,

And sought the hottest dangers of the fight,
The stoutest chiefs stood wond’ring far behind,

And none durst try to rival him in might Ξ
His ample shield then seem’d a gare of brass,

His awful sword did like the lightning shine !
Ν ο force of steel could through his armour pass,

His spear was like a mast, or mountain-pinel
Ev’n kings and heroes trembled at his name,
And conquest smil'd where’er the warrior came Ξ
Great was the strength of his unconquer'd hand,

Great was his swiftness in the rapid race ς
None could the valour of his arm withstand,

None could outstrip him in the days of chace.
Yet he was tendet, mercifuL and kind3

His vanquish’d foes his clemency confest3
No cruel purpose labour'd in his mind,

No thought of envy harbour’d in his boeast,
He was all gradens, bounteous, and benign,
And in his soul superior to a king !

But now he's gone! and nought remains but woe

For wretched me; with him my joys are ssed,
Around his tomb my tears shall ever flow,

The rock my dwellffig, and the clay my bed !
Ye makls, and matrons, from your hius descend,

To join my moan, and answer tear for team
With me the hero to his grave attend,

And sing the songs of mourning round his bier,
Through his own grove his praise we will proclaim,
And bid the place for ever bear his name.
