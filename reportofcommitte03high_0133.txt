‘POEMS oF OSSIAN.

³1¹ he young heroes of Fingal fell,
Adorned with a robe of fame.

The sons of Louach fell,

The fix sons and the father.

κ The youth of Albion fell,

Slain are the heroes of Britain.
Fallen is the king of Lethhn's son,
Who always gave us his aid.
Generous and manly was his heart ;
Strong, at all times, was his armss’
‘⁴ But tell me, bard !

The son of my son, and of my loins,

Oscar‚ how did he hewidmvn the terrible battle ,ἓ

Jt were haid tq relatp,

Great were the tan< to tell,

The numbers ssain in that battle,

Who fell by the arms of Oscar.

Not swifter the catara& of a river,

Nor a hawk darting on a flight of birds ς
Not stronger the course of the foaming torrent,
Than Oscar in that battle. 1

He was, at last,

Like a branch that opposes a furious wind,
Or like a tree which budding green ¹
Refists the stroke of the woodman.

When he perceived the king of Eiin

In the midst of his host,

Forward Oscar russoed,

As rolls a waive to the shore.

As Cairbar saw him approach,

He wielded his keen spear,

And pierced him through with its point—-
Our chief cause of woe Ξ

Nor yet did Oscar turn,

But forward pushedto Erin's king:

A wound with might he grave,¹

'Which proved the strength of his blade.
