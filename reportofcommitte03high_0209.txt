LETTERS {ro DR. Brutis. 25

Those who entertain any suspicions of Mi: Macphcrson's
veracity in that respect, do not adven, that, while they are

‘ impeaching his honesty, they pay a compliment to his ge÷

' to his book from any thing, it must be from the avowed
¹approbation of men distinguished for judgment and taste.
Mr Macpherson had in this respect the satisfaction to find,
'that the spirit and manner of a few detached fragmentS,
,h-nded about in MS& and translated with no other view
than to satisfy the. curiosity of a private gentleman, were
so well relished that a larger conection v-:as earnestly de-
