Which are advancing towards us;
Like a hart driven to fury‚
Like a hawk among a ssight of birds,
Or a ruthless eagle pouncing in his strength.

Within the car is the strong-armed hero of swords‚
Whose name is Cuchullin, the son of Semo,
Son of Subath son of Begalt.
His red cheek 13 like the polished yew:
Lofty the look of his blue- rolling eye beneath the arch of his
His bushy hair is a waving flama, ‚ [brovw
As coming towards us, a fiery holt,
He wields both his forward spears, .

³} ειε ἰε

Like furious storms which come darkly frowning,
And rend the rocky peaks from their hius,
Toward each other approache'd the hostile heroes.
Like cataracts which fall from mountains,
To mix in the narrow pass of the desert,
Rough and instant we joined-battle ·
J To the breast of Lochlin’s king and his mighty host·
ῗ chiefs opposed shield to sh1e1d3
. Men met sword to sword.

The look of his blue-rolling eye is wide, beneath the dark
arch of his brow. His hair flies from his head like a flame,
as bending forward he wields the spear. Ib. p. 231, Α
