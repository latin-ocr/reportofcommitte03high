of making any transsations of them into English.
The first who seems to have conceivcd such an idea
was a young man, to whom the Gaelic was an ac-
quired language3 (who, from that very circumstance,
perhaps prized more what compositione he found
in it), Jerome Stone of Dunkeld‚ who it appears
had been at pains to colle& several of the ancient
poems of the Highlands‚ oi one of which, as a
specimen, he published a transsation in rhyme, in
the Scots Magazine, then the only periodicas pub-
lication in Scotland‚ for the month of January
1756, along with a short letter, addreffed to the
πὶ· ὀἱ the Magazine‚ which sufficiently indicates
his opinion of the poetical merit of those poems.
Smne, then only 20 or 21, in an obscure situation,
and with few opportunities of cultivating his native
'genius or talents‚ could not be supposed capable of
giving a very happy or impreffive transsation of Gae-
lic poetry, especially when fettered with rhyme,¹
which, even in the ablest hands, and those most ac-¹
customed to the construffion of English verse, af.
fords* always an unfaithful‚ and generally an impar-
fe& transcript of ancient poetry. His place of reli-
dence too, was unfavourable‚ either to the acquire.
ment of pure Gaelic, or the colleffion of the best
copies of the ancient poeti-y of the Highlands.

Without entering, however, into the dispute as to Fingal's 017⁴-
gin or kingdom, the Committee may here obser-ve, that scotland
and Ireland had anciently such constant communication and inter-
course, as to be considered almost one country ς and their poeti-
N'cal language is nearly, qr rather altogether the same.
