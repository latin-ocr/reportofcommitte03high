felf, has annexed to his publication. (Vide Dr
Smith's Differtation, p. 128.) A more particular
one the Committee wished to receive from him-
„self3 but‘ he frankly told its Chairman, that he
-had been so much disgustedf with the reception of
his book, as to have long banissied the remem-
brance from his mind; and that he had not even
kept a copy for his own use, to which he might
refer for an answer to his queries. Dr Smith’s let-
⁸*ters to Mr Mackenzie, however, contain so much
good sense, and so much rational remark on the
subject of the Committee's inquiries, that it is tempt-
“ ed to annex them entire to this Report, (Appendix,
ΝΟ. 5.) One passage the Committee will quote
here, as affording a strong proof of the Do&or’s
fairness and candour. He says, ‘ that on his ob.
serving in one of the poems one or two paffages
which he thought of uncommon beauty, the person
who gave it as ancient said he had composed those pa&
suges himself ,· that he, Dr Smith, imputed this at
the time to the man’s vanity3 but that he thought it
right to state it to the Committee.' Whether such
person might compose one or two passages in those
poems, the Committee will not pretend to decide3
but when one looks over the list of those from whom
the Doctor collected his originale, and considers
their rank and situation in life, their education and
opportunities of improvement, to believe that they
could compose such poems2would be a degree of
credulity much greater than is necessary to believe

in the authenticity of Offian.
