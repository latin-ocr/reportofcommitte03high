ἕ Beldearg spoke with sweetest voice—
“ Hero of the gentlest eye, who art fairer
Than the morning on the {kirt of the mountain!
The valiant Conal has sent us to vifit thee.
—Who thou art, and what thy country,
Or in what tower thou hast been reared,
And what movet} thee to come to Erin,
Over the roaring seas of whitening billows ?

This Conal defired us to nequest,
And that thou wouldst go along with us to his divelling,

To partake of the feast of the chiefs,
And listen to the soothing softness of songs.'

Conloch‚ who was restrained by a promise made
to his mother from telling his name or country to
any but to him by whom he {hould be vanquished in
combat, declines the invitation, and refuses any an-
swer to Conal’s inquiries. Beldearg and his fifteen
,companions in arms fight with the young hero, and
are succesfively overcome. Conal himself, informed
of their overthrow, goes to meet this stranger hero.
His address to Conloch‚ and its consequenceS‚ are
thus related in the original.
