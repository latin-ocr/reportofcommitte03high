·1. Extractsrom a Poem ΟΝ ΒΕΑΤΗ.

 

O DIBCORD! gnashing fury! rav'nous fiend!
Hell's sharpest torment! nauseous qualm of life Ξ
You bathe the poniard uft in friendship’s breast ;
Peace‚ virtue, friendship, harmony and love,
Delightful train of graces, shrink from thee ;
Vice, envy, villany, deceitful thoughts,
Blood-thirsty cruesty, insatiate pride,
War, woe of mothers and new-married maids‚
Attend thy shrine, and thence long-plighted leagues
And unity are broke‚ thence streams of blood
Flow from the patriot's honest-thinking heart3
And rapine, bloodshed‚ camage-,train of death,
Resistless, restless, tear th’unhappy world
