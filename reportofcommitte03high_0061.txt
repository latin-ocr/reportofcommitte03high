POEMS oF ossum. 35

stood in that line, and100ked on him, in his com-
merce with Johnson, as aEted on by his leading
paffion; and, to acquire an eclat, otherwise inacces-
fible, determined to make that great umpire his
friend and panegyrist, and dreading what must happen,
did he oppose his, the Do&or’8, favourite and leading
prejudice. Iadmire the powers of his mind and
pen, and look upon him as a great and good man ;
but who has divested himself of every weakness?
To me he appears one of those ‘ who cannot bear a
rival near the throne.’ This weakness‚ I believe,
begot an inveterate, immoveable prejudice against
Mr Maepherson, and as Mr Maepherson could not
fall without making his country fall with him, the
winning, venerable Offian, must be sacrificed.

If, as is said, Johnson did not hear the return
made to his queries by Dr M‘Queen‚ and ‘'conclud-
ed it to be, not what in reality it was, but what he
wished, why did not ΜΓ Boswell, or some of the
company present, remove the Do&or’s mistake? and
if such an attempt was not then seasonable or expe-
dient, why did not Mr Boswell afterwards do justice
to Dr M‘Queen ?

Having‚ within these few years, read Boswell’s
Life of Johnson, on cool refleffion, I am made to
think that Dr M‘Queen made no reply to Dr John-
son ; or if he did, that it was so couched as to leave
Johnson in poffeffion of that prejudice he brought
from home, and with which he was determined to
return to it.
