⁸ Offian and the Clerk,' sometimes called ‘ the

Battle of Fingal and Manus ς’ ‘ Mar mharbh Diar-
mad

Thus, in p. 13.ι l. 47. of Ossian agas an Clericb,

‘ vMizfein, agus m’athair, is Gon,
Triur bo rnho glonn san fhein,'

is rendered in the transsation given by Mr Hill,

> ⁴ Myself, my father and Gaul, were those
Who had most children amongst our heroes ;’

instead of the true,.meaning‚

‘ Myself, my father and Gaul, were the three ’
Of greatest prowess among the heroes-⁹

And again, p. 22. second stanza of Urnfigh Osa-ian, ⁸ Oiihein nan
Glonn’ is transsated ‘ O ! Offian of many children,’ instead of
‘ O Ξ Offian of the deeds⁸of prowess! From which passages Mr
Hill is led to remark, ‘ that being the father of many children it
ever accounted a great honour among barbariam)

At page 24, stanza 18,

v ‘ Sgan a chreideas me do fgeul
A cleirich led leabhar ban

Gum bithidh Fionn na chomh fhial,
Aig duine no aig Dia an laimh.’

Thus Englisszed in the translation of Mr Hill ε

‘ 1 can hardly believe thy tale, thou light-haired and unworthy
clerk ! that the heroes of our race should be in captivity either to
the devil or to God.’
