tioned its having received from Mr John Mackenzk,
Mr Maepherson’s executor, containing the engage-
ment of Fingal with the spirit of Loda‚ in the poem
entitled Carrickthura. The entire specimen will be
found in the Appenfflx, No, 12. p. 162.

The Committee subjoins the paffages in the ori-
ginal Gaelic, which it has analized, with a rigidly
literal transsation into English, and annexes the trans-⁴,
lation given by Maepherson. From such anaiyfis

its opinion, which it thus puts in the Society's power
to reje& or to confirm, that, in the original, the
'scene and its circumstances are given distinessy 3 they
,γ are embodied in clear and accurate description 3 that
in the transsation by Mr Macpherson they are fre-
quently lost in words, of which the sound pleases
, the ear, but which are of a general, indeterminate
sort, that might belong to any other place or obje&
of a fimilar kind.
