Pons or OSSIAN. 135

The epithets in the transsation, of aged, midnight,
and shaggy, are not in the original, and instead of
the figurative expreffion of the winds in their wreus),
the original, according to the fimple language usual
in Gaelic‚ is the wind, and it high, that ιε, the wind
when 1t is high.

⁴ Bha gorm-shiubhal nan srutha thall
Is osag mhal o chuan bha faoin.' †

‘ The blue moving (course) of the streams was opposite,
And a ssow breeze from {he sea, which was idle (quiet or at

[1-est).²

‘ The blue course of a stream was there: the ionely blast of
ocean pursues the thistle’s beard.’

This piffiure of the wind pursm'ng the thistle’s heard
seems a favourite one with the transsator, as it is
found in many passages of his work ; but it is here

⁴ altogether unwarranted by the original, which how-

ever is much more beautiful in its description of the
gentle breeze from a calm or quiet sea. The soft
, fiow of the Gaelic lines is strikingly accordant with

the scene they describe.
