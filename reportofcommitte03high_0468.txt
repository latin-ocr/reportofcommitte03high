284 Lossn BANNATYNE’S LETTER.

'the remaining part are not unlikely to be obtained from
Capt. Sime of Stuckgarvan‚ his nephew and heir.

It is foreign to the subject of this letter to enter into par-
ticulars now much better known to you and the other mem-
bers of the Committee than to me, while the exzxnnnauon
made by Mr. Donald Smith, with the aid of Γπ. Mack-
intosh, shows their contents to be in many rresp eccs curious
and interesting. I feel some satisfaction in having been
the accidental instrument of bringing under the notice of
the Society‚ and probably preserving from heing irrecover-
ably lost, what is perhaps the most valnable rernains of
Gaelic manuscript now existIng in this country.

I cannot conclude this letter without rernm-king, that in-
dependently of the various accidents to which, even with
every care for their preservation, such MSS. as those in
question must have been exposed from the destruction of
the religious houses at the Reformation‚ from the subse-
quent feuds and civil wars, and latterly the two Rebellions‚
during which the houses and the property of the first fami-
lies„ in the Highlands so often suffered devastation and
plunder, and their proprietors were driven into exile, or
suffered on a scaffold ; the state in which this Kilbride Col-
lection was found, exhibits a striking proof of the destruc-
tion to which such papers were exposed from the careless-
ness of their owners3 and affords a strong presumption
that the> MSS. accidentaly recovered, bear a very small
proportion to those which once existed in a country where
they were equally liable to perish by violence or by neq
glect. I always am,

My dear Sir,
Your very faithful and obedient Servant,

WM. MACLEOD BANNATYNE, .
