pressioris must have ceased to form a part of our tonguer
were they not found in the poems of Ossian, and illustrat-
ed or quoted by other bards and aged men, who frequent-
ly allude to them.

Though we do not find these poems to correspond pre-
cisely in every expression over all the Highlands and
Isles, when repeated by different persons, they au corre-
spond in substance5 and there is not one instance, in any
corner of this country, in which one poem is found cona·
trary to the rest, or in opposition to their general character.
And though it were attempted to make the ablest scholar-
translate these poems into English, or any other tongue,
he surely could not transfuse into them the merits of the.
original; but stin less could he (as is alledged) first com-
pose them in English, and then turn them into such Gae-
lic as should retain the bone and marrow of their own true
language.

Let the opponents of Ossian then point out to us poetry
of equal merit with his, composed in any language, not>
an original one, and in a fictitious one, and referring to a
nation and a history altogether fabulous. I suspect they
would expose themselves to ridicule by the attempt. Many
poets after Ossian endeavoured to copy or to imitate him,
but there is no man that understands our tongue, or the
nature of our poetry‚ but will, on the first hearing of the
first verses, easily distinguish their poems from his.

He mentions some poets who lived before him, and who
sung the exploits of the heroes of their age: he himself,
in like manner, sings the deeds of the Fe'inne, as he had
heard or witnessed them in his earlier years. He was suc-
ceeded by other bards, who transmitted the history and
poetry of their countrymen from generation to generation„
The chieftains, and men of influence in the Highlands,
rewarded and supported those barda who not only comss
posed original poems, but also recited the compositione ςέ
