He struck Art the son of Cairbar ’
With the second stroke.

So fell that hero,

Graced with his royal crown.

Who have traversed many lands t
Alas ! that I survive the heroes,

To relate the tale of woe 1'

The Society will observe, that the second of those
poems¹ is the same story—,gg with that called by Mr
Maepherson, in his transsation, the Maid of Craca‚
and the third 18 on the [ψῦξι-

the first 18 sad and solemn, and perfeffly agrees with
the traditionary belief as to the fituation of Offian,
when he survived anthe heroes of his race. It is
scarcely necessary for the Committee to repeat, that
these, and all the other transsations given in this
Report, are striffly literal‚ and must therefore be
expected to convey to the mere English reader a
very imperfe& transcript only, either in point of
force or tenderness, of the original.
