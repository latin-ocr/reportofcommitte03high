Ι have thus, my dear Sir, given you as fun an account
as I could of all that Ι remember concerning the discovery
and publication of the poems of Ossian. I shall be hap-¹
py if it give any satisfaction to that very* respectable asso-
ciation of gentlemen to whom you wish it to be communi-
cated, and to which I have myself the honour of belong-
ing, in the station of an Honorary Member. I have per·
haps been minute and tedious in my narration of particu-
lars, but as I am now among the oldest persons alive who
had any hand in that discovery and publication, I imagin-
ed that even some of the small circumstances I have men-
tioned, may be considered as of some weight. I confess
I cannot avoid considering the discovery of the works of
Ossian as an important aera in the annals of taste and lite-
· rature3 and the share which I have had, in contributing
towards it, as a part of my life, by which I have deserved
well both of this age and posterity. I have the honour to
be, with much esteem and respect,

My Dear Sir,
Your most obedient, and
faithful humble servant,
HUGH BLAIR.
