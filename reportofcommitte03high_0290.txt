⁸ The story makes each heart but thine to bleed,

And fills both men and maids with keenest grief Β
Behold thy daughter, beaureous as the sky

When early morn ascends yon eastern hius,
She lov’d the yourh who by thy guile did die,

And now our ears with lamentations fills:
''I'is she, who sad, and grovefflng on the groundst
XVeeps o'er his grave} and makes the woods resound.

A thousand graces did the maid adom:
Her looks were charming, and her heart was kind ξς
Her eyes were like the windows of the morn,
And wisdom's habitation was her mind.
A hundred heroes try’d her Iove to gai113
She pity'd them, yet did their suits deny ς
Young Albin only courted not in vain,
Amin alone was lovely in her eye :
Love fiss’d their bosoms with a mutual flame3
Their birth was equal, and their age the same,

Her mother Mey, a woman void of nuth,

In practice of deceit and guile grown old,
conceiv’d a guilty passion for the youth,

And in his ear the shameful story told:
But o’er his mind she never could prevai13

For in his life no wickedness was found3
With shame and fage he heard the horrid tale,

And shpok with indignation at the sound ²,
He fied to shun her ; while with burning wrath
The, monster, in revenge, decreed his death.

Amidst Lochmey‚ at distance from the shore3
On a green island, grew a stately nee,
With precious fruit each season cover’d o’er,

Delightfnl to the taste and faix to seez
