24 LETTERS To ΒΡ». BLAIR.

thered together, than that which Mr‘Macpherson has given
to the public. The world may say of him and his trans-

lationsrwhat they please3 but I am convinced, for my ;·

part, that I heard most of these poems repeated, since I
remember any thing at all3 and I dare say, at that time,
ΜΓ Maepherson could neither read nor write, far less be

⁴she author of such a work. ’'
(Signed) Dux. MAc Nrcor.

This letter, of which you are· at liberty to make wha't
use you please, and the evidence which, in my presence,
you had from Μι- Maepherson of Stornaway, ‚afford a di·-
rect proof that the poems of Ossian are no imposition upon
the public. I know nothing stronger that can be offered
‘to remove the doubts that may have been entertained con-
cerning the authenticity of these poems, and, I am persuad-
ed, a single testimony of that kind will give entire satisfac-
tion to every one whose scruples are not founded on pre*
judice. χ

Ι have wrote down the passages which ΜΓ Maepherson
repeatedin your house; and every one that reads them,
allows that they lose by the translation.

Your acquaintance, Mr Fraser, received a letter from Mr
⁴Mac Lagan, preacher at Amalrie‚ in which he mentions
some detached pieces he transmitted to Mr Maepherson the
'transl220r, particularly several passages in the two last
'boelis of Fingal. The poem, called Erragon, or Lora,
a11tzost entire, and a poem which bears some resemblance
-w the opening of Temora. I told you formerly that I saw
'the originals which Mr Maepherson collected in the Hi gh-

dands. Μι- Fraser will assure you that he saw them like- ,

{wise, and was frequently present with Mr Macphcrson
‚when he was translating them: and no man will say that
she could impose his own originale, upon us, if we had
common sense, and a knowledge of our mother iongue.
