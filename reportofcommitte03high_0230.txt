ority over all bards was never called in question, were their
peculiar care.

Hence we are under some obligations to blaephersom

the poems of Ossian, which must otherwise have probably
perished. The race of rour bai-ds is, however, extinct,
and much of our poeti-‘y is lost, though a great deal'still
remains. ’
