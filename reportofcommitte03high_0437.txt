‘⁶ Be γε blest, be γε victorious !'’
Said the son of Comhal of conquering pursuits‚
‘⁶ Bloody Mfinos of ferocious chiefs‚

Like furious winds from the lofty mountain55
When the divide their darkly-frowning force,
We advaded to the strife of death.
We soon reddened our spears
And our broad full-tempered swords.
Τὴε F ingalians of close battles
Were victorious over the sons of the race of strangers⁷
And while they= lowered their heads in battle,
Each chief fulfilled his promise.
At the commanding voice of the son of Comhal,
They fell like a grove which had ceased to blossom.
Lovely fair, whose bosom was whiter than the breast of the
WVhen stately swimming [swan‚
She parted the waviug flood!
Thou wert listening to the sound of the vallies;
The sun become darkened with clouds,
Ceased to gladden the mount of the silent vale ;
Lowring pillars forming along the skies„

’ Now, like an hundred different winds that pour through
many vales; divided‚ dark the sons of Selma advanced,
Cromla echoed around ! How can Ι relate the deaths, when
we closed in the strife of arms! O daughter of Toscar!
bloody were our hands! The gloomy ranks of Lochlin
fell, like the banks of the roal-ing Cona! Our arms were
victorious on Lena: each chief fulfilled his promise! Be-
side the murmur of Branno thou didst often sit, O maid!
thy white bosom rose frequent, like the down of the swan
