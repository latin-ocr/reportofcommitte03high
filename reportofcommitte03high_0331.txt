oN' Mic. mLL's summm. 14³i

“ The' next poem is an account of the Death of Bran,‘
4‘ Fingal’s celebrated dog :” on which it is sufficient to re-
mark, that, close by onev of the ancient ruins in Glenlyon,
’ described by Mr. Hill,· as already mentioned,· there is an
erect stone, called Gonabhacan, or the Dog-stake‚ to which
, Bramaccording to the tradition of the neighbourhood! used ¹
'⁵ to be bound.

ζ’ Ι Traditions of this kind, it is true, are not peculiar to
Ῑ Scotland‚ but common to it with Ireland3 where the scenes
ὲ of Fingal's hunting adventures are still pointed out. But
they prove the fallacy of Mr. Hill’s observation‚ that “ th'e
r (θ songs themselves mention oms-y lirin, or Ireland, its pecu-
3'· -S‘ liarities and traditions.’' Especially, as the two songs
last named make no mention either of Ireland, or of Scot-
ζ . land; and of the other five‚· which he has published‚ there
⁷ are but four that mention Ireland‚ and one of these, which
’Ἰ mentions both countries‚ agrees with the fifth, which rnen-
) tions Scotland alone, in representing the latter as the' proper
, land of the Fingalians.
’ Mr. Hill's error appears to have proceeded‚ in part, from
’ an impression which was made upon him by the first verse
’ of the, translation of the poem which relates the Death of
Oscar. ‘⁶ I am very sad after thee‚‘ Chaoilte l since those
ι( who were my contemporaries are departed. I am filled
“¹ with grief.,‘ sorrow, and pain, since my foster-brother is
’ ‘⁶ gone foom me.”¹ On which he remarks in a note, ‘⁶ The
. ‘'‘ intimate connection of fosterage here so strongly express-1
·‘'‘ ed, is in a great degree peculiar to Ireland, and seems
·“‘ strongly to point out the origin of this song †.”
Now it is certain that the intimate connection of fosterage.
fs no more peculiar to Ireland‚ considered in eomparison'
ἢ with Scossand, than sadness after friends and departed con-
temporaries is peculiar 'to it3 as Mt. vHil‘l might have'
