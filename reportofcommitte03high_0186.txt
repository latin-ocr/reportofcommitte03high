with which the courtships of princes were carried on in the
poet's days.

The Address to the Evening Star claimed attention, on
account of its inimitable beauty and vharmonious versifica· ,
tion. The original of this piece suffered even in the hands
of Mr Pvlac'pherson3 though he has shewn himself inferior
to no translator. The copy or edition which'he had of
this poem is very different from mine3 I imagine it will,

But after you have convinced men of the m'cest taste in'
Europe, it would be a mistake in an}r one to endeavour to ⁴
convince those who have not the power of believing, or ’
