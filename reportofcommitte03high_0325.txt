” -“ In this' letter, (says Mr. Hm), Mac Nab seems to
⁶⁶ imply that the Fingalians divided their time between
9⁴ Ireland and Scotland3 though the songs themselves>
⁶⁶ mention only Erin or Ireland, its peculiarities and tradi-
⁶⁶ tions. The following Song, called Ossian’s Prayers,
⁶⁶ which indeed is in many respects the most curious of any,
. ⁶⁶ is also the only one he gave me that mentions Scotland
‘⁶ or Allabinn. He, however, related to me the history of
‘⁶ another song3 a copy of which has been published by
⁶‘ Smith in his Gaelic Antiquities, under the title of The

by ΜΓ. Hill himself, represents the F ingalians as residing
in Scossand, and going thence to hunt in Ireland3 and that
they also make repeated mention of the peculiarities and
traditions of the former kingdom. It is sarther certain,
that Crom-ghleann nan elac-h is mentioned in the Gaelic
poems as a residence of Fingal3 and that the reciters of
them allege it to be Glenlyon in Perthshire‚ where a round
building formed of huge stones without mortar or cernent,
is still known by the name of Tigh Chrom-ghlinn nan X

‘⁶ one of the principal abodes of the Ffflgalians, lies in the
„ ⁶⁶ western part of Perthshire., on the borders of Argyle-
⁶⁶ shire, near Loch Tay.

⁶⁶ Throughout this country are many ruins of rude stone
⁶⁶ walls, constructed in a circle; the stones of which aro
⁶⁶ very large: these are said by tradition to be the work of
⁸⁶ Fingal and his heroes. 'One of these ruins is close by
