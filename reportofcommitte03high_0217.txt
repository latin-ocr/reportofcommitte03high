Luda'n- Covinus, or Covinarius, seems to have been de·-
rived from the word Coffinf in the Teutonic language,
which was a branch of the old Celtic3 and though it was
imported to England very probably by the Saxons, it is
lost in the Gaelic. Our fathers, who were in use to carry
their dead betwixt two horses to the congregation-house
of all living, called a coffin cat-haid, which is the very
‘word that Ossian uses every where for a car3 so that'
your letter is very expressive> of my idea of Cuchullin's

I have just now before· me a poeti-cal relation, by Ossian,
of the interview betwixt FingaI and hisv friends, and Luno
the son of Leven, who made the swords of which I sent
you a description in the postscript to my last, in which
Luno is pointed out as a very wil-d savage‚- going upon one*
leg, with a staff in his hand, clad in a mantle of black

riores pellibus sunt vestiti, I know it must have been then
so, as they could only have learned the manu-facture of
cloaths and linens,- from what they saw among the Ro-
mans,- or from strollers from Gaul, who might have been
led to the secret of eloth-making by their neighbourhood
with the Roman Colony, or with Massilia; but it seems,
in Caesar’s time, few or no experienced manufacturers hadj
found their way to our country; yet, in a poem of Os«
sians, whose scene lies in Ireland, (it is no other than his
own courtship with Everallin), I find mention made of the
Belgae and Teutones, though this is omitted by the trans-
