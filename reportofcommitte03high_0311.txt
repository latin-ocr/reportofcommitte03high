ξ’ ‡ St. Patrick‚ Jesuit-like, seems willing to compound with Ossian3 :md to
'Yadmit the Pagan song& provided ossian, on the other hand, would admit
ᾗ· christianity. Part Of this verse is scriptur-11, “ So the last :hall beflrst and ibe
{ufirst last, fbr many are calla-‚l bnt fiw chosan' Matth. xx. 16. and see also
Mark iz.- 85. Jcsus Christ is here meant by the title of God. See v. 28.

‡ The opposition of Ossian seems to be considerably weakened in this
verse: but he still wishes to see his old superstitious maintain thesuperiurity
at least.
