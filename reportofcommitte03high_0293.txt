DAUGHTER oF MEY. 109

Though pale with sear, she plunges in the wave,
And to the hero's hand a dagger gave :

Alas ! too late3 yet gath’ring all his force,
,He drags, at last, his hissing foe to land.
Yet there the battle still grew worse ancl worse,
And long the conflict lasted on the strand.
At‘length he happily descry’d a part,
Α Just where the scaly ‘neck and breast did meet3
Through this he drove a well-directed dart,
And laid the monster breathless at* his feet.
The lovers shouted when they saw him dead,
While from his trunk they cut the bleeding head.

But soon the venom of his mortal bite
Within the hero’s bosom spreads like fla1ne3
His face grew pale, his strength forsook him quite,
And o'er his trembling limbs a numbne'ss came.
Then fainting on the slimy shore he fell,
And utter’d‚ with a heavy, dying groan,
These tendet words, “ My lovely maid, farewell ἶ
Remember Albin; for his life is gone ! ’'
These sounds like thunder all her sense oppress,
And swooning down she fell upon his breast.

At last, the maid awak’ning as from sleep,
F elt all her soul o’erwhelm’d in deep despair,
Her eyes star’d wssd, she rav'd, she could not weep‚
She beat her bosom, ancl she tore her hair !
She look’d now on the ground, now on the skies,
Now gaz'd around, like one imploring aid.
But none was near in pity to her eries,
No comfort carne to soothe the hapless maid !
Then grasping in her palm, that shone like snow,
The youth’s dead hand, she thus exprcs'd her woe.
