²76 LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE.

edition of the original, the translation may not exactly cor-
respond with any single edition that may now be found.
From having compared the ofiginal and translation of a
few passages and parts of poems many years ago, the
impression that remains upon my mind is, that the liberty ‚
taken vasa's no more than I thought allowable3 and I am .
persuaded, that it would have appeared to be still less if I
had the translator’s own edition.

In what Ι have said, I wish to be understood as speak-
ing only of the first'volume published by Mr Macpherson,
of which a number of the poems, episodes, and incidents
were known to me in the original: and as some of these
were among the most beautiful in the collection, I ean easi-

first3 butI do not feel myself authorized to speak of it
in the same terms, as Ι do not remember to have heard any
of it in the original, except what relates to the death of
Oscar. I thought, too, when I read it, which was a long
time ago, that the stile of some parts of it was more curt,
abrupt, and affected, than the rest of the poetry of Ossian.
I should therefore suspect, that if the translator used too
much liberty in any part of his work, it was in this3 in
which he* seems at least to have condemned and fettered the
sense, more than perhaps the genius of the original would
well bear. I do not recollect whether this observation
may be justified by the specimen of the original which I
had seen, published with the first edition; but I recollect,
that upon comparing that specimen with the translation, ,
Ι observed several words of which (as I thought) the able
translator inadvertently mistook the meaning, which could
not well be supposed to have been the case, if, as some al-
ledged, any part of it was of his own composition. As
Mi· M. collected most of his originals in the North High-
