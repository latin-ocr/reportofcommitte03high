THE omia or mmm„ 341

Camil, the mild, strong, and elegant,
F ell breathless under the press of valour3
Relenssess, fieree, and ruinous was the stroke
Which laid the champion low ln the hard fought con-

test!

⁴⁶ My darling‚ my child, my love,
Sad ιε the wound thy death inflicts on thy fatherl’
Said F lngal with sp1rit heavier drooping

Than the sun overcast by the sudden cloud of thunder.

Δ “O Carrivl ! thou son of my love Ξ ’

..⁴¹² Glosed are thine eyes, locked thy teeth of whiteneSS‚
t Thy ‘strength is swept away as by a mast,

Thy beauty is changed as the blossom of branches.
“ No more shalt thou be seen
To tread the path to condiet,
No more shall be heard the sound of thy shie1d‚
Thou pride of battles ξ coming to my aid.
'⁶‘ Would t-hat‘the overbearing strength of stt-angers
Or the king of the world had laid thee low 3
Τ hen, O Carril ξ should I avenge thy death
Upon the Britons of victorious arms Ε
“ Blest be thou, O graceful Carril ἔ
Who defeated hundreds in battle.
Thou travelledst far, but farther still did reach thy·
fame
To every land where thy name was known.
‘⁴ Chearful‘‚ sprightly and 'enlivening,
In the hall os Temora, among hundredsj
O hero! bloody in the chace !--
Sad to· -day ιε the tale os thy death.
' ‘⁶ Would that thou hadst fallen 1n the battle of waz-
rlorS,
Fair and gentle hero of the auburn ringlets' .
Then would the race of Comhal revenge the injury⁹
