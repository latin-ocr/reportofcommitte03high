3. LITERAL TRANSLA'TION OF THE ORIGINALae

ΤΗΕ sigh of 3 friend in the grove of Frao'ch 1
A sigh for the hero in it's rounded pale,
A sigh which causes each man to mourn,
And which makes each maiden weep 2

There, to the westward, is the Carn ἒξ,
Which covers F raoch‚ son of Fiach‚ of the soff hair,-
He who obeyed the call of Mey,

And from whom that Cam of F raoch has its name.-

The maids from Cruchan weep,
Sad is the cause of their woe,
For their mournful sighs are occasioned,
By F raoch, son of F iach, of the ancient wmpons,

Him most bewails the maid
Who comes to Weep in the grove of F raoch,
ἡ Τ118 brown-eyed fair of 811111113- locks,
Only daughter of Meyv, whom the heroes obey.-

Only daughter of Corul of finest hair,
XVhose side to night is stretched by the side of Fmoch, .
Though many were the men who sought her love,
She loved none but Fraoch.
