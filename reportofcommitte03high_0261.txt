lands, itis probable he may have found there the greater
part of the 2d Vol. although we had bu‘t little of it in the
West; at least so far as I had access to know, for I am
far from thinking that I heard the whole of what was
known to my countrymen, as Ι removed early from those
higher parts in which those poems were more generally
known and recited. In a conversation which I had lately
on this subject with Dr Fraser, minister of Inveraray, he
mentioned a James Nicholson, sometime ago minster in
sky, whom he had often heard for hours together repeat—
ing some of Ossian’s poems, and recited to me a few of
those verses which he still remembered. They were part
of the description of the horses in Cuchullin's car, and
contained one or two epithets which neither he nor I could

member right, of Ossian’s poetry published in Mr Shaw's
grammar, and several in Gillies’s collection, but, as I ob-
served before, little can be made of one edition, without
others to correct it. One or two other poems, ascribed to
Ossian‚ have been also published some years ago in the
Gentleman's Magazffle, by a Mr Hill, an English gentle-
man, who had picked them up in an excursion through
. the Highlands. One of these, which is a Dialogue be—
tween St Patrick and Ossian, I often heard, and thought it
an aukward but ancient attempt to imitate the Celtic bard,
by some person who did not advert to the anachronism.
But I had occasion to observe lately, in Colgan, an Irish
