(O ad reverse ! O fatal hour
In mangled heaps to die ἰ)
Too mighty Erin 3 to thy power,
Pale victims, here they lie.”v

Kennedy’s edition of the poem goes on to relate, that
after the fieet of Lochlin proceeded to sea, the men, abash-
ed at the failure of their enterprize, prevailed upon Manos

= to alter his course, and steer for the'shore they. had left, to

renew the attack upon Fingal3 which counsel proved
disastrous in the issue, Manos himself, and most of hig
people, having fallen in the battle which followed 111011·
second landing. This conclusion of the poem will best apag
pear from the original. ‚

Bumhor an toirm ar an treigh.
