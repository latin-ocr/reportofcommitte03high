10 REPORT ON THE

that Noble Lord, at his defire. Ι believe him a very
good man ; a better man than a politician. ·

Since writing the above, 1 have been in company
with Mrs Montague‚ a lady of great distinction in
¹ this place, and a zealous partizan of Offian. I told
her of your intention, and even used the freedom to
read your letter to her. She was extremely pleased
with your p'rojeEt3 and the rather, as the Duc de
Nivernois‚ {he said, had talked to her much on that
subject last winter, and defired, if poflible‚ to get
collected some proofs of the authenticity of these
poems, which he proposed to lay 'before the Aca-

* ⁵demie de Belle Lettres at Paris. You see, then,

that you are upon a great stage* m this inquiry‚ and
that many people have their eyes upon you. This
is a new motive for rendering your proofs as com-
plete as poffible. I cannot conceive any objeffion
which a man even of the gravest character could
have to your publication of his letters, which will
-only attest a plain. fa& known to him. Such scru-
ples‚ if they occur, you must endeavour to remove-;
for on this trial of yours will the judgment ,Of the
public finally depend.

Lord Bath, who was in the company, agreed
with me, that'such documents of authenticity are
entirely neceffary and indispensable.

Please to write to me aa soon as you make any
, advances, that I may have something to say on this
{subject to theqliterati of Paris. I beg my compli-
ments to all those who bear that character at Edin..
