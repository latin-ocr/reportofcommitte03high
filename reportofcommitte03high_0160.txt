Having put in mossy towers in the preceding line,-
he gives their tops in this, though the expreffion in

flame’ is a metaphyfical idea, putting in a refiex at·-

friends of the distress of their chief3 but, in the ’
original, the epithet dall, blind, is a well known

Gaelic epithet for smothered flame, which exaffly
expsfflses what every one has seen in kindling straw'

or other materials for fire fignals.

Bha leadan air a chul a sti-i 3²

He saw the wind without strength.

His hair (I‘ocks) was on his back struggling. μ
The filence of the king was not vain? (without meaning.)

looks back to the lagging winds. His hair is disordered on hit ’
back. The filence of the king is terrible.’
