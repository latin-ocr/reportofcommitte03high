LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE- 91

ther copy of the book has ever done so much service.
I admire your zeal in a matter to which only your
*zeal could give much importance. But nothing would
be done to purpose, if we did not attach importance to
it, while we are engaged, as, no doubt, Î™ did, at the
time, to the translating of Gaelic poems. I am, with

respect and regard,
Dear Sir,
Your most humble servant,
JonN Smrn.
