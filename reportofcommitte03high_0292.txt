With joy he finds the dragon fast asleep,

Then pulls the fruit, and comes in safety back3
Then with a 6116311111 countenance, and gay,

He gives the present to the hands of Mey.

“ Well have you done, to bring 1116 of this fmit ε

Go pull the tree entirely by the root,
And bring it hither, (11· Ι cease to live. ’'
Though hard the task, like lightning fast he ssew,
And nimbly glided o'er the yielding tide ;
T 11611 to the tree with manly steps he drew,
And pull’d, and tugg’d it hard, from side to side:
Im bursting roots his strength could not Withstand3
He tears it up, and bears it in 1115 hand,

Or fix his footsteps on the solid sand,
The monster follow'd with a hideous soar,

In vain 3 for round the bloody current fiows,
While his fierce teeth his tender body gnaws.
He grqans through anguish of the grievous wound,

And 61165 for help3 bu†, ah ! no help was found!

At length, the maid, now wond’ring at his stay,'
And rack’d with dread of some impending ill,
Swift to the lake, ’ἑο meet him, bends her way ;
And there beheld what might a virgin kill 1
She saw her lover struggling on the fiood,
T 116 dreadful monster gnawing at his side ;
She saw young Albin fainting, while his blood ⁷
With purple tincture dy'd the liquid -tide Ξ
