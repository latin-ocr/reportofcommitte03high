It appears from the words'fl ‚Ut ea ferebat aetas‚” that
Ο Flaherty considered the tale of the TAIN as a composi·

tion of the age to which> it trelates: So that the Critical .

Exposition prefixed to this ancient ¹copy must have escaped
the diligent and successful search that he made for materials
m his Ogygi& And as he was the friend and pnpil of the
, family of Mac Firbis, the most learned and intelligent of
the professed Antiquarians of 'Ireland †, there isreasqn to
believe that the'Exposition in question, was not milywtit-
¹ten, butcomposed in Scossand, and that- it was 'either un-
known to the Irish Antiquaries, or overlooked by them.

Be that as it may, it sets forth that Sheanachan, with the
three chief bards, ancl those in their retinue, being called
upon for the , history of the Tdin bhv, or cattle spoil, of
Cuailgne, when they were taking their departure from the
Court of Guaire, acknowledged themselves* ignorant of it.
That they made their grand rounds of Ireland and of Scot-
land in quest of it, but to no purpose ss· That Eimin and
Muircheartach, two of their number repaired at length to
the grave of Fergus son of Roich‚ who, being invoked, ap-
'pearedn at the end of three days in awful majesty, and re-
cited the TAIN from beginning to end, as it is detailed in
the twelve Reimsgeala‚ or Portions‚ of which it is made
up.

The historical Anecdotes begin with that which is en-
graved on Plate II. herewith presented, and relates to Ossian
,the son of Finor² al, whom it represents as showing an inclina·
tion in early life, to indulge in solitude his natural propensity
to meditation and song. It is to be read as follows:

† Rod. Ο Flahert. Ogyg. p. 233. Ogygia vindicated in Pref. (viii. ix.)
