2¹2 LETTERS '1¹0 DR. BLAIR·

they are, of that kind that Mr Maepherson, I think judici*
*ously rejects, as Irish imitations of the works of Ossian.
*One Angus Fletcher, a sherriff-officer, was here about two
days ago at my desire, he can repeat many of these poems,
but none of those Mr Macpherson has translated, except a
part of the poem entitled, the Battle of Lora, and that
very much corrupted. But from my own memory, Ι can
assure you, that Μο113’ 3 proposal to Cuchullin, Finga1‚
1).11. p. 26, with Cuchullin' s answer, and Morla' s reply,
is 3 just translation. So 13 the whole episode of Borbar
and Ε31113330113, Fingal, b 111. p. 45 and 46, and Fingal,
b. iv. p. 57 and 58, from ‘f we reared the sun beamsss’
&a to “ now like 3 hundred different winds ’' Ι can
⁸still repeat some of these 111 the original. The whole
poem of *Dar-thula I have frequently heard, but Ι ranem-.-
ber no part of· it. All these, and many more, I heard 111
the Island of Sky, when I was a =little boy,'‘ from an old
man who used to repeat them to* me for some tobacCO‚ which
I procured 111111 as often as Ι wanted to hear them. This
man died when Ι was but very young, and I could never
since meet with any person that could repeat so many of
the poems of 0331311, ·01· 30 perfeetly. I am sony I cannot
give you or the public any more satisfaction on this point.
Had such an enquiry been made fifty years sooner, I am
persuaded hundreds could attest that Mr Maepherson' s
translations are really what they pretend to be. Witlg
31113313 esteem, Ι am γ
