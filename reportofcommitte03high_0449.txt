II. Sronzm agrees in meaning with the German sturm,
and the Dutch and English stmm, which Minsheu in his
Etymological Dictionary, derives from the Latin sterno.
Had that learned author been acquz ntrd with the Celtic,
he would have found a happier etymon in noir-m, which is
itself derived from toirm, a loud murmurind noise.

The affinity which a nuzn'r er of Teutonssc words bear to
the Celtic is, in part, a natural and necessary consequence
of the first peopling of Europe, and the near neighbourhood
of the Celtic and Teutonic nations in ancient times.

Of the several races o. rnen by which Europe is inhabit-
ed, it is certain that the Celtic people were the first who
moved westward from Asia, the region to which the uni-1-
form evidence of history, whether sacred or profane, refers
as the original seat of mankind. For Herodotus, the oldest
historian of Europe now extant, has remarked repeatedly
(Euterpe, C. 33. Melpom. C. 49.), that the Celtae
were possessed, in his time, of the extreme westerly
point of the European continent. That they formed settle-
ments in the countries which they passed in the course of
their migration from east tc· ωας-τ, we may judge by the
traces which they left of their name3 Strabo having re-
marked (Lib. XI.) that the olei writers of Greece called all
the northern nations (meaning those of Asia and Europe
alike) by the name of Scythians and Ocho-Scythiam, and
le'y having given us to understand (L. VI. c. 13.) that
the Lytarmis promontory, which is «z pposed to be the
Cape os 01)ςῇ now regarded as the extreme boundary of
