LETTERS ro niz. BLAIR. ’ 29

some old men who value themselves for having gained
some of these wagers. The Highlanders‚ at their festivals
and other public meedngs, acted the poems of Osslan.
Rude and simple as their manner of acting waS, yet any
brave or genereus action, any injury or disti-ess, exhibited
in the representation, had a surprising effect towards rais-
ing in them corresponding passions ancl sentiments.

It was in my house that Mr Maepherson got the de-
scription of Cuchullin’s horses and car, in book lst, p. 11,
from Allan Mac Caskie, schoolrnaster‚ and Rory Mac-

· leod, both of this glen: he has not taken in the whole of

the description ; and his translation of it, (spirited and
pretty as it appears, as far as it goes‚) falls so far short of
the original in the picture it exhibits of Cuchullin's horses

' and car, their harness and trappingS, Sec. that in none of

, his translations is the inequality of Macpherson’s genius to
' that of Ossian so very conspicuous. Α ¹

, The battle of Lena, in book ml, is still preserved by
tradition in this country, but with this variatim, that the
” proposal of giving up his wife and dog, in p. 26, as the
only condition on which peace would be granted, was made
by Magnus, king of Lochlin‚ to Fingal, and not by Swa-
ran to Cuchullin. It was a principle with Fingal, from
which he never deviated‚ not to engage in battle without
first offering the best terms of peace his honour would per-
mit. Agreeably to this principle, he sent proposals to
'Magnu53 in return to which, Magnus demanded his wife
and dog, which Fingal rejecting with indignation‚ the battle
began.

I have heard the poem, in book sd, relating Fingal’s
voyage to Lochlin‚ the snares laid for him by Starno‚ death
of Agandecca, how for liis cruelty and perfidiousness he
t'ook immediate revenge on Starno, when, p. 38, he eyed
his valiant chiefs‚ his valiant chicfs took arms.
