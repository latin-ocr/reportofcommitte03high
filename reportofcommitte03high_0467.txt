- MR. MACKENRIE. 283

your assistance in enabling them to lay before the public,
I took occasion, in going to Inveraray, to call on ΜΓ.
M‘Kinnon at Glendaruel. Reminding him of what had
then passed, and asking whether he had himself seen the
Kilbride collection, he told me he had not, but that he had
then by him a Gaelic manuscript, got from some country
people in his neighbourhood, which had once, they said,
'made part of that collection, which appeared to him very
ancient, ancl though he could not easily read it on account
of its numerous contractioris, he found it to contain Histo-
ries‚ Tales, and Poems.

Ι This manuscript, as you kz-ow, I prevailed on him to
send by me for the use of the Society. It is generally un-
derstood to be of cosxsidrrible antiquity, as the late Mr.
William Robertson of the Register Office supposed, not
later than the l3th century..

The circumstance of this manuscript also being supposed
to come out of the Kilbride collection, induced me to make
inquiry, lwhat part of that collection still remained in the
possession of Major Mac Lachlan, who was my personal
acquaintance. The result you know was, that by means
of the Rev. Francis Stuart minister of Craignish, 1 obtain-
ed a confirmation of the fact, that his family had once pos-
sessed a very large collection, of which he had given two
or three to Gener-al Sir Adolphus Oughton, and the late Sit
James F oulis, both of whom were Gaelic scholars, and that
there still remained above twenty in his possession.
¹ Of these he allowed Mr Stuart to bring a few to my
house in Bute for my inspection, all of which appeared to
me to be of some antiquity. Those were returned3 but,
at my request‚ Mr. Mackintosh was, as you know, allowed
to take inspection, and bring the Society an account of
these and the other MSS. in Major M‘Lachlan’ s possession.
Part of these the major afterwaic'ss sent to ῑῘιεἛοοίεῖῩ,· and
