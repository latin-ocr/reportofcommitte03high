Never didan enemy find me captive.
But have you considered that high-masted fleet?
Or who he is that sways its host? ’ [strong,

We never forsook the fighting hosts
In the day of slaughter, in the mldst of battle.
We have stood the foremost in the front of conssict‚
Where frequent was the play of keen-edged swords.
Did we ever shun the death of wounds?
From the stroke of hundreds did we shrink in dismay ?
To day a nurnberless host descends upon our hills,
And Fingal is not present.
It is not safe to go forth to meet them,
While thou hast but the youth of Inisfail.

, son of Semo, hear my voice, regard the ancient throne of

Cormac. Give wealth anl half* the land for peace, till
Fingal shall ari-ive on our coast. Or, if war be thy
choice‚ I list the sworl and spear. My joy shall be in the
