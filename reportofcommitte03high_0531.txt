Itis with infinite concern the Committee has to

inform the Society of the death of its excellent co·
adjutor, Dr D. Smith, who died, after a very short

illness, on the very day (22d May 1805) when the
last of his labours in its service, the concluding
sheet of this Appendix, issued from the press. The
Committee has to sympathize with every lover of
Celtic literature, on the loss of a scholar and anti-
quarian, whose extent of knowledge, whose acute-
ness, and whose industry, have seldom been equal-
ed. Its acquaintance with him, on occasion of com-
piling this Report‚ induces the Comrnittee to add
another praise, not less just, nor less honourable,
though of less general concern, in its sincere regre'ts
for the loss of those many virtues and estimable
qualities (not less estimable for the simple and un·

assuming manners that accompanied them) which

Dr Smith possessed as a man.
