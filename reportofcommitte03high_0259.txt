as were the poem of Darthula, perhaps the most beautiful
in the collection, called in lssaelie by the name of Clann

book of Temora, known by the title of Bds Oscair (the

Different editions of the same poem were, as you may
well suppose, very widely different, from their having
been recited for ages by different persons and in different
places, so that, without having the translator’s corrected
