6 LETTERS To DR. BLAIR.

I am not at all surprised that, at a time when the spirit of
party, and national quarrels, are risen to such a height, the
authenticity of Ossian’s poems should be called in question.
The glory arising to our country and ancestors‚ from these
N noble monuments of genius, cannot miss to give pain to
the malevolent in the southern division of the Isle3 and,
as a great person who has patronized Fingal, must not only

gentleman may very probably have all the MSS. formerly
'belonging to these old lauream, if preserved, in his custody x ’
and though I understood by your letter that Macleod has
undertaken to write to Clanranald upon this subject, I have,
immediately after receiving yours, written to the Minister
of the parish where these bards lived ; and intreated him,
