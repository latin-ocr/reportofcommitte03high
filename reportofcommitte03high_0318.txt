But mark the translation of it which Mr. Hill has given to
‚the public. ‘⁶ I can hardly believe thy tale, thou light-2
.“ haired and unworthy Clerk Ξ that the heroes of our tace
“ should be in captivity either to the devil or to God.''

It were idle to search for a key to this translation. But-

q it supplies a note to Mr. Hiss, which proves that he paid

n0¹ less attention to the natural history, than* hev did to the
radical structure of the Erse. “ Why, (says he) was light
⁶⁶ hair esteemed an opprobrium? the Erse themselves are a
ἰ( red-haired race.’²

Stanza 24. .“ Sa Phadruig nam bachoil fial²⁹ is trans-2
lated ‘⁶ Generous Patrick of the innocent staff !'' instead of
Patrick of the generous Have-55 an unmeaning expression
resulting from writingfial‚ instead of fiar, which last, sig,-
nifies crooked5 Mr. Hill‚ however, very happily stumbles„
on the truth, when he observes in a note that ‘⁶ perhaps
‘⁵ the innocent stcff mentioned -in v. 24. may have some re-
“ ference to the crosier.’² For certain it is that the pastoral
staff of the primitive teachers οἱ Christianity‚ both> in Scot-
land and Ireland, was called Bahal, after the Roman bacu-
lus, baculum, or bacillum, and that, like the lituus of the Ro-
man Augurs, it was crooked: For which reason it also got
the name of Cambhatta or. crooked staff, as the crosier of
that Abbot columbanus is termed, by whom the monastery

of Bobio in Italy was founded in the year 614. ‘⁶ Qui et ’ ’

“ baculum ipsius, quem vulgo Cambuttam vocant, per ma-
“ num Diaconi transniiserunt*.’?

A piece of land is still held in the island of Lismore, by
virtue of a grfflit from an Earl of Argyll‚‘ on condition that
the holder do keep and take care of the Baculus of Mzzluag,
after whom its ehurch is named, From which circumstance
